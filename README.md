[SOUNotes](https://sounotes.vercel.app/) is a website specifically for SOU-BCA students, offering structured and easily accessible study materials.

## Features

In today’s time, students rely heavily on online resources to complement their academic studies. To address this need, I have developed a responsive and user-friendly website specifically for SOU-BCA students, offering structured and easily accessible study materials. SOUNotes was successfully implemented using modern technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Markdown parsing with Remark and Rehype.
