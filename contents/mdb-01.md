## Database Management System

- A DBMS is software that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases.
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and Redis.

### Functions of DBMS

- Data storage, retrieval, and update
- User access control
- Backup and recovery management
- Query processing

### Components of DBMS

- **Database**: The physical storage of data.
- **DBMS Software**: Interface between users and the database.
- **Query Language**: Languages like SQL to interact with the database.
- **Users**: Admins, developers, and end-users.

## Types of Databases

### Relational Database

- **Structure**: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
- **Schema**: Fixed schema (predefined structure).
- **Query Language**: Uses SQL (Structured Query Language).
- **Scalability**: Primarily vertical scaling (upgrading hardware).
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
- **Use Cases**: Financial systems, customer relationship management, and inventory management where data consistency is crucial.

### NoSQL Database

- **Structure**: Data is stored in various forms, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns.
- **Schema**: Flexible or schema-less, no fixed structure.
- **Query Language**: Depends on the database type (e.g., MongoDB uses query methods; Cassandra uses CQL).
- **Scalability**: Primarily horizontal scaling (adding more servers).
- **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, Neo4j.
- **Use Cases**: Big data, real-time applications, social networks, content management systems, and when handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

### NewSQL Database

- **Structure**: Combines relational database structures with the scalability of NoSQL.
- **Schema**: Uses relational models but supports high scalability.
- **Query Language**: SQL, similar to traditional RDBMS, but with additional features for scalability.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling like NoSQL but with ACID compliance.
- **Examples**: Google Spanner, CockroachDB, NuoDB.
- **Use Cases**: Applications that require the scalability of NoSQL but still need the ACID compliance of relational databases, such as cloud-based applications and large-scale web services.

## MongoDB

- MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database.
- MongoDB is a popular, open-source **NoSQL database** designed to handle **unstructured** and **semi-structured** data
- It is based on a **document-oriented data model** and stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called **BSON (Binary JSON)**.
- MongoDB stores data in a **JSON-like document** that is more expressive, powerful, and **flexible** compared to traditional rows and columns format structure.
- MongoDB is known for its **high scalability, performance, and flexibility**, making it suitable for modern applications that need **to handle large volumes of data with varying structures**.
- The Powerful query language of MongoDB provides the capability to filter the fields without worrying about the depth of document nesting.
- It also supports the **aggregation** and the modern **geo-based search, text search, and graph search**

### Features of MongoDB

- **Schema-less Design**: MongoDB allows for flexible schema design, meaning each document (record) can have a different structure.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: It supports horizontal scaling via sharding, making it possible to distribute data across multiple machines.
- **Document-Oriented Storage**: Data is stored in documents (similar to JSON), which are grouped together in collections. This model is intuitive for many modern web applications, which often work with JSON-like data.
- **Rich Query Language**: MongoDB provides a query language that is expressive and allows for complex querying, filtering, and aggregation of data.
- **Indexing**: MongoDB supports indexing to improve query performance, allowing for faster searches and data retrieval.

### MongoDB Architecture & Components

- **Collections**: Analogous to tables in relational databases; store documents.
- **Documents**: JSON-like structures containing key-value pairs.
- **Replica Sets**: Ensure high availability and redundancy.
- **Sharding**: Distributes data across multiple machines for scalability.

### MongoDB Query Language

- MQL is designed for easy interaction with MongoDBâ€™s document-oriented data model.
- It supports a variety of operations such as querying, updating, deleting, and aggregating data.
- With its powerful operators and flexible query syntax, MQL allows developers to handle complex data structures and large datasets efficiently.
