- Content is generally described as **any type of text, graphic, image, video, form, or any other interactive element on the website, web page, or post**.
- Content has a central importance in any website.
- The nature of content depends on the type of business. Retail sites feature a catalogue of products. University sites contain information about their campuses, curriculum, and faculty. News sites show the latest news stories.
- A blogger should update the content regularly. You might have a bunch of observations or reviews for a personal blog. Without updated content, there is little reason to visit a website more than once.
- Some blogs have a single author, and some have multiple authors. Each author writes his/her own articles. Typically, blog authors compose their articles in a web-based interface built into the blogging system.
- Some blogging systems also support using stand-alone “weblog client” software, allowing authors to write articles offline and upload them later.

## What is Blog

- A “blog” is an updated version of the old term “weblog,” used to describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information.
- A blog features diary-type commentary and links to articles on other websites, usually presented as a list of entries in reverse chronological order.
- Blogs range from personal to political and can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects.
- Many blogs focus on web design, home staging, sports, mobile technology, etc.
- Few are more eclectic, presenting links to all types of other sites. And others are more like personal journals, presenting the author’s daily life and thoughts.

### Analyse Audience Demographics

- Identify factors like age, gender, income, education, and location.
- This information is crucial in understanding who makes up your target audience.
- Demographics provide a snapshot of who your potential customers are.
- This helps tailor your cold email outreach to the right groups.

### Identify Audience Interests and Behaviours

- Find out what interests your audience. Analyse their online behaviour, preferences, and purchase history.
- Knowing their interests helps in crafting messages that resonate.
- This step involves monitoring social media, forums, and review sites. You can use analytics tools to gain insights into what content your audience engages with.

## Basics of Storytelling & Narrative Structure

![](/cbw/04cbw3.png)

**Elements** of classic story structure:

- **Exposition**: This first part establishes a protagonist's normal life and greater desires, and usually culminates in the inciting incident.
- **Rising action**: The protagonist pursues their new goal and is tested along the way.
- **Climax**: Our hero achieves their goal — or so they think!
- **Falling Action**: The hero now must deal with the consequences of achieving their goal.
- **Resolution**: The conclusion tying together the plot, character arcs, and themes.

## Seven Story Structures Every Writer Should Know

### Freytag's Pyramid

![](/cbw/04cbw4.png)

Named after a 19th-century German novelist and playwright, Freytag’s Pyramid is a five-point dramatic structure that’s based on the classical Greek tragedies of Sophocles, Aeschylus, and Euripedes.

- **Introduction**: The status quo is established; an inciting incident occurs.
- **Rise, or Rising Action**: The protagonist actively pursues their goal. The stakes heighten.
- **Climax**: A point of no return, from which the protagonist can no longer go back to the status quo.
- **Return, or Fall**: In the aftermath of the climax, tension builds, and the story heads inevitably towards...
- **Catastrophe**: The protagonist is brought to their lowest point. Their greatest fears have come true.

### The Hero's Journey

![](/cbw/04cbw5.png)

Inspired by Joseph Campbell’s concept of the monomyth — a storytelling pattern that recurs in mythology all over the world — The Hero’s Journey is today’s best-known story structure. Some attribute its popularity to George Lucas, whose Star Wars was heavily influenced by Campbell’s The Hero With a Thousand Faces.

1. **The Ordinary World**: The hero’s everyday life is established.
2. **The Call of Adventure**: Otherwise known as the inciting incident.
3. **Refusal of the Call**: For a moment, the hero is reluctant to take on the challenge.
4. **Meeting the Mentor**: Our hero meets someone who prepares them for what lies ahead — perhaps a parental figure, a teacher, a wizard, or a wise hermit.
5. **Crossing the First Threshold**: The hero steps out of their comfort zone and enters a ‘new world.’
6. **Tests, Allies, Enemies**: Our protagonist faces new challenges — and maybe picks up some new friends. Think of Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road.
7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave**: The hero gets close to their goal. Luke Skywalker reaches the Death Star.
8. **The Ordeal**: The hero meets (and overcomes) their greatest challenge yet.
9. **Reward (Seizing the Sword)**: The hero obtains something important they were after, and victory is in sight.
10. **The Road Back**: The hero realizes that achieving their goal is not the final hurdle. In fact, ‘seizing the sword’ may have made things worse for them.
11. **Resurrection**: The hero faces their final challenge — a climactic test that hinges on everything they’ve learned over their journey.

### Three Acts Structure

![](/cbw/04cbw6.png)

Following the old adage that “every story has a beginning, middle, and end,” this popular structure splits a story’s components into three distinct acts: Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution. In many ways, the three-act structure reworks The Hero’s Journey, with slightly less exciting labels.

- **Act 1: Setup**:
  - **Exposition**: The status quo or ‘ordinary world’ is established.
  - **Inciting Incident**: An event that sets the story in motion.
  - **Plot Point One**: The protagonist decides to tackle the challenge head-on. She ‘crosses the threshold,’ and the story is now truly moving.
- **Act 2: Confrontation**:
  - **Rising Action**: The story's true stakes become clear; our hero grows familiar with her ‘new world’ and has her first encounters with some enemies and allies. (see Tests, Allies, Enemies)
  - **Midpoint**: An event that upends the protagonist’s mission. (Similar to the climax in Freytag’s pyramid)
  - **Plot Point Two**: In the wake of the disorienting midpoint, the protagonist is tested — and fails. Her ability to succeed is now in doubt.
- **Act 3: Resolution**:
  - **Pre Climax**: The night is darkest before dawn. The protagonist must pull herself together and choose between decisive action and failure.
  - **Climax**: She faces off against her antagonist one last time. Will she prevail?
  - **Denouement**: All loose ends are tied up. The reader discovers the consequences of the climax. A new status quo is established.

### The Story Circle

![](/cbw/04cbw7.png)

Another variation on Campbell’s monomyth structure, the Story Circle is an approach developed by Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon. Again, heavily inspired by the Hero's Journey, the benefit of Harmon's approach is its focus on the protagonist's character arc. Instead of referring to abstract concepts like 'story midpoint' and 'denouement', each beat in the story circle forces the writer to think about the character's wants and needs.

1. **A character is in a zone of comfort...** This is the establishment of the status quo.
2. **But they want something...** This 'want' could be something long-standing and brought to the fore by an inciting incident.
3. **They enter an unfamiliar situation...** The protagonist must do something new in their pursuit of the thing they want.
4. **Adapt to it...** Faced with some challenges, they struggle then begin to succeed.
5. **Get what they wanted...** Usually a false victory.
6. **Pay a heavy price for it...** They realize that what they 'wanted' wasn't what they 'needed'
7. **Then return to their familiar situation...** armed with a new truth.
8. **Having changed...** For better or worse.

### Save the Cat

![](/cbw/04cbw8.png)

Another variation of the three-act structure, this framework created by Hollywood screenwriter Blake Snyder, has been widely championed by storytellers across many media forms.

1. Opening
2. Set-up
3. Theme Stated
4. Catalyst
5. Debate
6. Break into Two
7. B Story
8. The Promise of the Premise
9. Midpoint
10. Bad Guys Close In.
11. All is Lost
12. Dark Night of the Soul
13. Break into
14. Finale
15. Final
