## Listening

- Listening is the ability to accurately receive and interpret messages in the communication process.
- Listening is key to all effective communication. Without the ability to listen effectively, messages are easily misunderstood.
- As a result, communication breaks down and the sender of the message can easily become frustrated or irritated.
- Listening is receiving language through the ears.
- Listening involves identifying the sounds of speech and processing them into words and sentences.
- When we listen, we use our ears to receive individual sounds (letters, stress, rhythm and pauses) and we use our brain to convert these into messages that mean something to us.
- Listening in any language requires focus and attention.
- It is a skill that some people need to work at harder than others.
- People who have difficulty concentrating are typically poor listeners.
- Listening in a second language requires even greater focus.
- Listening is so important that many top employers provide listening skills training for their employees. This is not surprising when you consider that good listening skills can lead to better customer satisfaction, greater productivity with fewer mistakes, and increased sharing of information that in turn can lead to more creative and innovative work.

## Barriers to Listening

**Physiological Barriers:**

- Some people may have genuine hearing problems or deficiencies that prevent them from listening properly. It can be treated.
- Some people may have problem in processing information or retaining information in the memory. For example Lack of concentration/interest.

**Physical Barriers:**

- These referred to distraction in the environment such as the sound of an air conditioner, cigarette smoke, or an overheated room. It can interfere the Listening process.
- They could also be in the form of information overload.
- For example, if you are in meeting with your manager and the phone rings and your mobile beeps at the same time to let u know that you have the message. It is very hard to listen carefully to what is being said. Arriving late for a speech, presentation or lecture.
- Therefore unavailability of listeners, Speaker or listener being distracted by disturbances will also be coming into physical barrier category.

**Attitudinal Barriers:**

- Pre occupation with personal or work related problems can make it difficult to focus one’s attention completely on what speaker is saying, even what is being said is of very importance.
- Another common attitudinal barrier is egocentrism, or the belief that the person has more knowledgeable than the speaker, or that there is nothing new to learn from the speaker’s ideas.
- People with this kind of close minded attitude are very poor listeners.

**Wrong Assumptions:**

- The success of communication depend on the both the sender and receiver.
- It is wrong to assume that communication is the sole responsibility of the sender or the speaker and those listeners have no role to play. Such an assumption can be big barrier to listening.
- For example, a brilliant speech or presentation, however well delivered, is wasted if the receiver is not listening at the other end.
- Listeners have as much responsibility as speakers to make the communication successful. The process should be made successful by paying attention seeking clarifications and giving feedback.
- Another example: Assuming that the speaker is going to give some unimportant information or Pre-judgments about the speaker.

**Cultural Barriers:**

- Accents can be barriers to listening, since they interfere with the ability to understand the meaning of words that are pronounced differently.
- The problem of different accents arises not only between cultures, but also within a culture.
- For example, in a country like India where there is enormous cultural diversity, accents may differ even between regions states.

**Gender Barriers:**

- Communication research has shown that gender can be barrier to listening.
- Studies have revealed that men and women listen very differently and for different purposes.
- Women are more likely to listen for the emotion behind a speaker’s words, when men listen more for the facts and the content.

**Lack of Training:**

- Listening is not an inborn skill. People are not born good listeners. It is developed through practice and training.
- Lack of training in listing skills is an important barrier.
- In lack of training people do avoid listening to difficult, boring or complex information and selectively listen only to what is considered interesting.

**Bad Listening Habits:**

- Most people are very average listeners who have developed poor listening habits that are hard to say and that act as barriers to listening.
- For example, some people have the habits of “faking” attention, or trying to look like a listeners, in order to impress the speaker and to assure him that they are paying attention.
- Others may tend to listen to each and every fact and, as a result, miss out the main point. For example judging the speaker by his/her mannerisms, voice, appearance, accent, etc

**Emotional barriers:**

- Emotional barriers are emotional factors that get in the way of effective listening.
- These include both positive and negative emotions, such as being excited, angry, upset, or distracted.
- It’s difficult to focus on something else when emotions come in the way of concentration.
- For example, if you’re upset about something that happened earlier in the day, it will be challenging to focus on what the person in front of you is saying. If you’re angry with someone, you’re less likely to be very receptive to things they have to say. And if you’re distracted by something exciting going on in your life, you won’t be able to focus on the speaker very well.

**Language Barriers:**

- In our global society, a language barrier is probably one of the most common obstacles to effective listening.
- It can exist when there is a language difference between the two individuals talking or when one person has a poor understanding of the spoken language.
- It is important to note that a language barrier does not have to be an issue of nationality or ethnicity. It could simply be a difference in dialect.
- For example, someone from the south of England may not understand someone from the north of England because they speak with a different accent or even use other expressions.

**Information overload:**

- When there is too much information coming at someone, it can be challenging to focus on one thing.
- This often happens in business meetings when people are presenting either new or complex information.
- It can also occur during conversations when the person you are talking to gives you too much information at once.
- In either case, the listener will not focus on what is being said and will probably miss important details.
- An example of information overload can be found in a business meeting. Imagine you are in a meeting where the speaker presents information that does not seem relevant to your job or tasks.
- This can cause you to become distracted and lose focus.
- As a result, you will miss important details that could affect your work performance.

**Time Pressure:**

- This barrier is based on the idea that people feel they do not have enough time to listen.
- Time pressure can come from a number of different places, including from within oneself or from an external source.
- For example, if you are running late for a meeting, you will probably be less inclined to spend time listening to everyone’s ideas than if you had more time available.
- Alternatively, if you feel impatient because the person speaking is taking too long, you might feel unable to focus on what they are saying.
- Because of this, it could be hard to focus on what the other person is saying, and you may stop listening and start preparing your excuse for leaving

## Importance of Listening

Listening skills are a vital part of good communication. If you have good communication skills, you can start to improve relationships in the workplace as well as in society.
Also, you will be able to make decisions more effectively and reach a quicker agreement with others.

**Providing Feedback:**

- The goal of feedback is to send signals to the speaker to know that you are actively listening.
- The medium of feedback can be verbal or non-verbal.

- Displaying skills in presentation will earn you immediate respect both while you are debating and in other situations where you need to be in front of a group of people talking.
