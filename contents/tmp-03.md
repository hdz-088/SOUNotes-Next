- Productivity refers to the physical relationship between the quantity produced (output) and the quantity of resources used in the course of production (input)
- “It is the ratio between the output of goods and services and the input of resources consumed in the process of production.”
- Productivity is the ratio between output of wealth and input of resources used in production processes.
- Output means the quantity of products produced and the inputs are the various resources used in the production. The resources used may be land, building, equipment, machinery, materials, labor etc.
- Productivity means an economic measure of output per unit of input. Output refers to the total production in terms of units or in terms of revenues while input refers to all the factors of production used like capital, labour, equipment, etc.

## Productivity Meaning

- Productivity refers to the physical relationship between the quantity produced (output) and the quantity of resources used in the course of production (input)
- “It is the ratio between the output of goods and services and the input of resources consumed in the process of production.”
- Output implies total production while input means land, labour, capital, management, etc. Productivity measures the efficiency of the production system.
- The efficiency with which resources are utilized is called productive efficiency. Higher productivity means producing more from a given amount of inputs or producing a given amount with lesser inputs.
- At the level of a plant or an industry productivity is an output-input ratio. But at the macro level, productivity is a measure of performance of an economy or country.
- From a nation’s viewpoint productivity is the ratio of available goods and services to the potential resources of the country.
- Productivity means an economic measure of output per unit of input. Output refers to the total production in terms of units or in terms of revenues while input refers to all the factors of production used like capital, labor, equipment, etc.
- Productivity is a good indicator of the efficiency with which a factory is operating. If a firm has higher productivity, i.e. it produces more with a given amount of inputs; it means it is utilizing the resources properly.

## Productivity Concept

- The concept of productivity can be applicable to any economy, small, medium and large business, government and individuals.
- Productivity aims at the maximum utilization of resources for yielding as many goods and services as possible, desired by consumers at lowest possible cost.
- Productivity is the ratio of output in a period of time to the input in the same period time.
- Productivity can measured with the help of following formula:

**Productivity = Output / Input**

- In simple terms Productivity is the ratio of output to some or all of the resources used to produce the output.

## Importance of Productivity

- Individuals and companies may both benefit from productivity. Productivity helps people and groups more efficiently and effectively manage their time, complete their tasks and accomplish their goals.

- **Reduced Stress**:

  - People with higher levels of productivity can reduce their stress levels. When you are more productive, you use less excess energy and resources to accomplish your tasks. Managing your time and energy more efficiently often helps increase your confidence in completing things of higher quality and by their deadlines

- **Improved well-being**:

  - Increasing your productivity may help your overall health and wellness. Spending less time on your tasks gives you more opportunities to take care of your mind and body.
  - People with greater productivity are also often more aware of their mental and physical states.
  - For example, they are often better at judging when they need to take a break.

- **Improved sense of purpose**:

  - People who are more productive often understand the reasons behind what they are accomplishing.
  - Knowing the purpose behind your actions helps motivate you to take those actions.
  - The purpose behind your action could relate directly to the action itself, such as wanting to solve a specific problem at work, or the purpose might relate to something you can do after you complete the task.
  - For example, if you need to send a lot of emails in one day, the sense of purpose motivating you might be those emails can help you eventually reach your business's long-term goals.

- **Deeper engagement with work**:

  - Greater productivity helps boost your engagement with your work.
  - More productive individuals often see the tangible difference their efforts and time make in reaching larger projects or goals.
  - Feeling in control of your workload helps you engage more deeply with your assignments and raises your productivity level.

- **Improved moods**:

  - Improving the quality or quantity of your work can increase your body's production of endorphins.
  - Endorphins are chemicals that help reduce pain and increase feelings of joy.
  - When you feel more accomplished, your body is more likely to release endorphins.
  - The mood boosts these endorphins provide can then help increase your productivity even more.

- **More sustainability**:
  - Improved productivity can sometimes help the environment. For example, suppose your increased productivity reduces the time you spent on a particular task by two hours.
  - Depending on your particular work environment, that could mean turning off lighting fixtures, heating and other power devices for an extra two hours, reducing your environmental impact.

## Difference between Productivity and Production

- Productivity and Production both are numbers –management wants both at peak. Let’s understand the difference between both

#### Productivity

- Productivity is the ratio of output to Input. It is an index which shows how effectively an organization is using its resources (inputs).
- In the case of a garment factory, the output can be taken as the number of pieces produced, while “inputs” are the people, machines and time.
- To understand the difference in a better way let’s take one example –
- Suppose a garment factory produces 5000 pieces in a day with 500 operators.

#### Production

- Production is a process to transform raw material input into an output which will have desired quality.
- Production is just a number or quantity of output produced at a particular time.
- Production is measured with respect to unit time.
- Production can be measured with the different department also like
- Production of cutting department, sewing department and sewing department.

## Time management tools and techniques

- **Use a Time Planner and Create a Master List:**

  - The first time management tool that you need is a time planner that contains everything you need to plan and organize your life.
  - The best time planners, whether looseleaf binders or electronic versions, enable you to plan for the year, the month, the week, and for each day.
  - A good time planner will contain a master list where you can capture every task, goal, or required action as it comes up.
  - This master list then becomes the core of your time-planning system.
  - From this master list, you allocate individual tasks to various months, weeks, and days.

- **Work From a List:**

  - Every effective executive works from a daily master list. It is the most powerful tool ever discovered for maximum productivity and it’s one of the best ways to help achieve your [**SMART goals**](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/smart-goals/).
  - When you create your daily list, you begin by writing down every single task that you intend to complete over the course of the day.
  - The rule is that you will increase your efficiency by 25% on the very first day that you start using a list.
  - This means that you will have two extra hours of productive time in an eight-hour day from the simple act of making a list of everything you have to do before you start work.
  - You can bring order out of chaos faster with a list than with any other time management tool.

- **Organize By Priority:**

  - Once you have a master list for your day’s activities, the next step is for you to organize this list in order of priority.
  - Consider [using a time management matrix](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/time-management-matrix/) to determine what tasks are truly urgent and important.
  - Once your master list is organized, it becomes a map to guide you from morning to evening in the most effective and efficient way.
  - This guide tells you what you have to do and what is more or less important.
  - You will soon develop the habit of using your list as a blueprint for the day.  Read this [post on eat that frog](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/) for more tips.
  - Remember that **[the 80 20 Rule](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/how-to-use-the-80-20-rule-pareto-principle/)**, also known as the Pareto Principle, says that 80% of your results will come from 20% of your efforts.
  - Therefore, the key to maximizing your efficiency is prioritizing the tasks that contribute to the majority of your gains.

- **Time Management Tools and Systems:**

  - The variety of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computer-based time planner systems available today is absolutely wonderful.
  - No matter what you do, in whatever field, there are digital time management systems that you can tap into or load onto your personal computer to help organize every part of your life.

- **Organize Your Time:**
  - The ability to organize your time is a priceless time management skill.
  - There is a simple method of organizing your time and your schedule for up to two years in advance.
  - It is called the “45-file system.” This is a tickler file that lets you plan and organize your activities and callbacks for the next twenty-four months.

### This is how it works:

- First, you get a box of forty-five files with fourteen hanging files to put them in.
- The forty-five files are divided as follows: There are thirty-one files numbered one through thirty-one for the days of the month.
- There are twelve files for the months of the year, January through December. The last two files are for the next two years.
- This is a wonderful system that you can also use with hanging files in your desk drawer.
- Get a [personal planner](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/personal-development-plan/) of some kind, whichever format you are most comfortable using (e.g digital or paper), and invest the time necessary to learn how to use it.
- The payoff in saved time and increased productivity will be enormous.

## Causes of Low Productivity

- **Lack of employee training:**

  - Lack of adequate employee training is the most frequent root cause of low employee productivity. Time and resource management are automatically hampered when employees are not properly trained
  - Untrained employees will inevitably consume more [time and resources](https://quixy.com/infographic/7-statistics-productivity-with-time-management/) than are required and end up producing low levels of productivity.
  - They will require supervisors to ensure that their tasks are being completed, and you will need other employers to review, correct, and correct any errors in their work.

- **Workplace Stress**

  - Imagine your coworkers never being able to concentrate on one thing because they constantly think about the next task they need to complete.
  - When worries about their jobs plague coworkers, they become disoriented, lose focus, and cannot meet their tasks as effectively as possible.
  - They might jump from one task to another when deciding how to use their time and finish as much work as possible.
  - As we are already aware, this results in work stress, which indicates more work done (under pressure) but with less efficiency.
  - This is one of the major causes of low productivity.

- **Too many tasks at hand**

  - If you search whether multitasking is beneficial or detrimental online, you will undoubtedly come across a wide range of sources, each of which will have a different opinion.
  - If you are the CEO or senior manager of a company, you probably want to assign as many tasks to your employees as possible, believing that this will ensure that they never have anything to do.
  - Consider that two projects (A and B) must be done, and it will take a week to finish each.
  - Now imagine that your coworkers begin juggling the two projects without paying particular attention to either.
  - After two weeks, both projects will be completed, but attempting to complete as much work as possible will cause Project A to be delayed by an entire week, with no advantages to Project B.
  - Instead, they will be able to complete Project A in one week and Project B in two weeks if they focus on one project at a time. [Time management](https://quixy.com/blog/time-management-activities/) can play a key role while enhancing productivity at work.

- **Toxic Work Culture:**

  - Often, toxic behavior at work results from individuals attempting to manipulate and sabotage the workplace.
  - Team members negatively impacted by this kind of behavior will be forced to consider their long-term futures within the organization due to their unhappiness.
  - This is more common in larger organizations where some staff members employ devious strategies to advance their careers and move up the corporate ladder.
  - Employees who engage in toxic behavior may experience stress in the long run, which can result in low productivity, work ethic, and [workflow](https://quixy.com/blog/tips-to-selecting-the-right-workflow-automation-software/).

- **Lack of Management:**

  - Poor management is one of the major causes of low productivity.
  - According to studies, almost [80%](https://empmonitor.com/blog/13-best-tips-to-increase-productivity/) of workers have encountered poor management, which demotivates them from giving their all to the organization for which they work.
  - There are still a lot of managers in organizations who like to micromanage their employees.
  - If your business realizes low employee productivity at work, it is often a sign to evaluate your management.
  - Today’s businesses need leaders to drive change and move their organizations forward.

- **Ineffective Organizational Structure:**

  - A significant contributing factor to your employees’ low productivity maybe your company’s poor organizational structure.
  - This can take many forms but typically occurs when you don’t fully optimize your workflow.
  - Very frequently, especially in larger organizations, there are circumstances where there is a lack of coherence between departments.
  - The likelihood of low levels of productivity at work will significantly increase even if there is a small amount of confusion about who is in charge of what or what is to be done next.
  - Establishing a proper structure can help you go a long way in keeping the productive juices for your employees running.

- **No Feeling of Belonging:**
  - The fact that employees don’t feel like they belong at the company they work for could be a significant factor in their low levels of productivity at work.
  - Every CEO or senior manager must make sure that the workplace culture welcomes new hires and does not leave them feeling undervalued.
  - If not, there is a greater chance that your new workforce will be less productive than the rest simply because they will feel out of place.
  - One study in the financial industry, for instance, found that only [20%](https://m.economictimes.com/jobs/88-employees-willing-to-stay-longer-if-appreciated-at-work-survey/articleshow/55202176.cms) of existing workers felt highly valued at work. When employees at one company feel like their efforts aren’t valued, it lowers productivity because it demotivates the workforce.
  - The sense of community at work greatly increases [workplace productivity](https://quixy.com/blog/workplace-productivity/). Employees’ spirits are raised when they converse and interact with one another while working. Lack of social interaction among coworkers can result in loneliness and isolation. They might become discouraged, which would result in low productivity
  - Social gatherings, open communities, etc., should be organized to fulfill employees’ social needs.

## Factors that help increasing productivity

- **Manage your focus, not your time:**

  - It’s easy to schedule every minute of your day with a huge to-do list. But it’s much harder to predict the right circumstances to focus on a complex spreadsheet or write a presentation.
  - Instead of managing your time, manage your attention. When are you most creative or energetic? When could you use a break for something mindless?
  - Spend a few minutes at the start of each day to plan out your must-do tasks.
  - Designate specific blocks of time to deep-dive on a project, brainstorm with your team or manage your phone notifications.
  - When you have a plan, it’s easier to ignore distractions and stay on task.

- **Debrief the day:**

  - Spend a few minutes at the end of the day assessing how things went. Did you accomplish everything on your list?
  - Did you get hungry or sleepy during the midafternoon slump? Did you block out the right amount of time for tasks?
  - By reassessing how things went, you can better plan the next day.
  - Maybe bump up the time you need to work on reports. Schedule a quick afternoon walk to clear your head. Keep notes so you can pick up any patterns and adjust.

- **Prioritize your tasks:**

  - We have such good intentions when we write our to-do lists. Then the inevitable “urgent” task pops up.
  - Our advice: Do the hardest or most annoying things first. Otherwise, you’ll spend all of your time doing little things to avoid it.

- **Learn to delegate:**

  - Are you a “Yes” person? Are people always asking you to help out on new projects, review presentations or sit in on candidate interviews?
  - Most diligent workers want to show dedication and a team-player attitude. But it’s not always the best use of your time, or the company’s.
  - If something makes the most of your talents, say yes! But if it’s a distraction or doesn’t take advantage of your skill set, suggest someone who’s better suited.

- **Update your to-do list:**

  - Refocus your lists on outcomes versus tasks. “Finish project” is likely not doable in one day. Put those on your weekly or monthly to-do lists.
  - What’s the biggest must-do for today? Choose one element of that big project to keep you moving forward.

- **Schedule fewer meetings:**
  - Yes, you still need meetings. But they need to be meaningful. Set a time limit for watercooler chitchat and then move on to business.
  - Have an agenda with allotted times per topic. If you don’t have an agenda or a clear outcome, maybe it doesn’t need to be a meeting.

## Productivity Index

- The Productivity Index is a metric used to measure the efficiency of production in relation to a set standard or baseline. It compares the output produced to the input used over a specific period.
- Calculation: **Productivity Index = (Actual Output / Standard Output) × 100**
- **Interpretation**:
  - A Productivity Index greater than 100 indicates that production is above the standard or expected level.
  - A Productivity Index of 100 indicates that production meets the standard or expected level.
  - A Productivity Index less than 100 indicates that production is below the standard or expected level.
- **Usage**: The Productivity Index helps organisations monitor performance, set benchmarks, and identify areas needing improvement to enhance efficiency.
