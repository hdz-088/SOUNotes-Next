## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
- Instead of owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.
- It allows you to access files and applications from any device that can connect to the internet.
- Simple Example: Google Drive for file storage, Gmail for email, Netflix for video streaming

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **Cost Saving**: You don’t have to spend money on buying and maintaining hardware and software. Pay-as-you-go pricing helps save costs.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down depending on business needs. Useful for seasonal or unpredictable demands.
- **Accessibility**: Access your services and data from anywhere at any time using the internet.
- **Performance**: Major cloud providers regularly update their services with the latest hardware for improved performance.
- **Security**: Many cloud providers offer a set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen security.
- **Flexibility**: Cloud computing gives you the option to test and deploy new applications quickly.

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **On-demand Self-Service**: Users can access computing resources as needed, without human interaction.
- **Broad Network Access**: Services are available over the network and accessible through standard devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Resource Pooling**: The provider’s resources are pooled to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model.
- **Rapid Elasticity**: Capabilities can be scaled up or down quickly and efficiently.
- **Measured Service**: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency.

## Cloud Service Model

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
  - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  - Includes virtual machines, storage, and networks.
  - Users manage the OS, storage, and deployed applications.
  - Example: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine
- **PaaS(Platform as a Service)**
  - Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.
  - Developers don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
  - Example: Heroku, Google App Engine
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
  - Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.
  - Managed by the provider including updates and security.
  - Example: Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox

## Cloud Deployment Model

- **Public Cloud**
  - Operated by third-party providers and deliver services over the internet.
  - Shared infrastructure among multiple customers.
  - Example: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Private Cloud**
  - Used exclusively by one organization.
  - Can be physically located at the company’s on-site data center or hosted by a third-party.
  - Offers more control and security
- **Hybrid Cloud**
  - Combines public and private clouds.
  - Allows data and applications to move between the two environments.
  - Offers greater flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure.

## What is AWS?

- AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a secure cloud services platform offered by Amazon.
- Launched in 2006, AWS offers compute power, database storage, content delivery, and other functionality.
- AWS is used by millions of customers including startups, enterprises, and public sector organizations.
- AWS offers more than 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

## AWS Use Cases

- **Web Hosting**: Host dynamic websites or web applications.
- **Data Backup and Recovery**: Store backups safely and recover them quickly.
- **Big Data Analytics**: Analyze large datasets and make informed decisions.
- **Mobile and Web App Development**: Build and deploy applications.
- **Machine Learning and AI**: Use pre-trained AI models or build your own.
- Gaming-Support game development with scalable infrastructure.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions**: AWS divides the world into geographic areas called Regions. Each region has multiple data centers.
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Each Region consists of several AZs that are physically separated.
- **Edge Locations**: These are content delivery endpoints that help reduce latency. Used by Amazon CloudFront.
- This structure ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency.

## AWS Free Tier

- A way for new customers to explore AWS services for free for 12 months. • Free Tier offers limited access to many popular services.
- **Examples**:
  - **EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)– 750 hours/month of t2.micro or t3.micro instances
  - **S3** (Simple Storage Service)– 5 GB of standard storage
  - **RDS** (Relational Database Service)– 750 hours/month of db.t2.micro or db.t3.micro
  - **Lambda**–1M free requests/month
  - **CloudWatch**– Basic monitoring
- Ideal for students, developers, and testers.
