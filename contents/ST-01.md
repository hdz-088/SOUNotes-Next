## Introduction

- Software testing is the process of evaluating a software program to find bugs, verify it meets expectations, and ensure it functions as intended.
- It's a crucial part of the software development lifecycle.
- Software testing aims to deliver a polished, high-quality product that meets user requirements and expectations.

## Approaches of Testing

- There are two main approaches to testing:
  - A **human tester** interacts with the software to assess its functionality.
  - Testers use scripts or tools to **automate** repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.

## Testing During SDLC

- **Requirements Analysis**: Testers are involved early on to understand the software's purpose, functionalities, and user needs. This helps identify potential testing areas and ensure requirements are clear and testable.
- **Design Phase**: Testers collaborate with designers to review the software's architecture and identify potential design flaws that could lead to testing challenges later.
- **Unit Testing**: Individual software units (modules) are tested by developers to ensure they function as designed.
- **Integration Testing:** Once units are tested, they're integrated to form a larger system. Testers verify if these integrated components work seamlessly together.
- **System Testing:** The entire software application is tested as a whole to ensure it meets all functional and non-functional requirements (performance, usability, etc.).
- **Acceptance Testing:** Real users or potential customers test the software to provide feedback on its usability and functionality from an end-user perspective. This helps identify any user interface or experience issues.

## Requirement Traceability Matrix

- A Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM), also known as a **Cross-Reference Matrix (CRM)**, is a table-like document used in software development and other fields to track the relationships between different project artifacts.
- It essentially creates a map that shows how requirements are implemented and verified throughout the development process.

### Benefits of using RTM:

- **Improved Verification and Validation:** Ensures all requirements are addressed by design and testing processes.
- **Enhanced Impact Analysis:** Helps understand how changes to a requirement affect other parts of the project.
- **Stronger Project Management:** Provides a centralized view of project progress and potential issues.
- **Efficient Change Management:** Simplifies tracking the impact of changes on related deliverables.

## Essentials of Software Testing

**Robust Testing Strategy:**

- This high-level plan outlines the overall testing approach for the project.
- It defines what types of testing will be conducted (functional, performance, etc.), the order of testing, and the resources needed.
- A well-defined strategy ensures a targeted and efficient testing effort.
  **Detailed Testing Plan:**
- This plan dives deeper into specifics, outlining the individual test cases that will be executed.
- Each test case should map back to specific requirements to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- The plan should also include details on the testing environment, data required, and expected results.
  **Well-designed Test Cases:**
- Effective test cases are the backbone of thorough testing.
- They should be clear, concise, and cover a wide range of scenarios, including positive and negative test cases.
- Strong test cases help identify defects and edge cases that might otherwise be missed.
  **Relevant Test Data:**
- The quality of your test data significantly impacts the effectiveness of testing.
- You'll need a variety of data sets to simulate real-world usage and expose potential issues.
- This may include valid, invalid, and boundary value data.
  **Ideal Testing Environment:**
- A stable and reliable testing environment is crucial for accurate and repeatable test results.
- The environment should mirror the production environment as closely as possible to avoid surprises when the software is deployed.
  **Defect Tracking and Reporting:**
- A system for logging and tracking discovered defects is essential.
- This allows testers to document issues, prioritize them based on severity, and track their resolution throughout the development process.
  **Testing Expertise and Skills:**
- Effective testing requires a skilled team with a deep understanding of testing methodologies, tools, and best practices.
- Testers should be able to analyse requirements, design test cases, and think critically to uncover potential issues.
  **Communication and Collaboration:**
- Throughout the testing process, clear communication and collaboration between testers, developers, and other stakeholders are essential.
- This ensures everyone is aware of identified issues and works together to resolve them effectively.

## Principles of software testing:

- **Testing Shows Presence of Defects, Not Absence:** Testing aims to uncover bugs and malfunctions, not definitively prove software is flawless.
- **Early Testing Saves Time and Money:** Identifying defects early in the development lifecycle is much cheaper and easier to fix than waiting until later stages.
- **Defect Clustering:** The Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) often applies in software testing.
- **Pesticide Paradox:** Repeatedly using the same tests with minor variations may not uncover new defects.
- **Testing is Context-Dependent:** The testing strategy should be tailored to the specific software, its intended use, and the project's priorities.
- **Absence of Errors Fallacy:** Finding no defects during testing doesn't guarantee a perfect product.

## Importance of software testing:

- **Improved Software Quality:** Testing helps identify and fix bugs, leading to a more robust, reliable, and user-friendly product.
- **Reduced Risk of Failure:** By proactively uncovering issues, testing minimizes the risk of software failures after deployment.
- **Enhanced Security:** Testing helps identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Pesticide Paradox:** Repeatedly using the same tests with minor variations may not uncover new defects.
- **Testing is Context-Dependent:** The testing strategy should be tailored to the specific software, its intended use, and the project's priorities.
- **Absence of Errors Fallacy:** Finding no defects during testing doesn't guarantee a perfect product.

## Process Problems Faced by Testing

- **Incomplete Requirements:** Testers often face issues when requirements are not well-defined or are incomplete.
- **Insufficient Test Planning:** Poor test planning can lead to unorganized and ineffective testing efforts.
- **Lack of Resources:** Testing teams may lack the necessary resources, such as skilled personnel, tools, and environments.
- **Inadequate Test Coverage:** Use risk-based testing approaches to prioritize test cases and ensure critical areas are thoroughly tested.
- **Time Constraint:** Testing often gets squeezed at the end of the development cycle, leading to rushed testing.
- **Communication Gaps:** Foster open communication channels and use collaboration tools to improve information sharing.

## Software Testing Terminology

Software Testing terminology means **collection of inputs and expected outputs**.

- **Failure:** The inability of a system or component to perform a required function according to its specification.
- **Fault / Defect / Bug:** Fault is a condition that in actual causes a system to produce failure. It can be said that failures are manifestation of bugs.
- **Error**: When a developer or a team makes any mistake in any phase of SDLC, errors are produced. It might be a typographical error, a misleading of a specification, a misunderstanding of what a subroutine does and so on. Thus, error is a very general term used for human mistakes.
- **Testware:** The documents created during the testing activities are known as Testware.
- **Incident:** Any problem (such as queries, defect reports, or test script failures) that requires investigation by the test team.
- **Test bed:** Test bed is an environment where testers run their test cases. It includes hardware, software, network configuration, and other necessary elements for performing tests.
- **Test Case:** A test case is a set of actions and conditions used to verify a feature or functionality of a software application.
- **Test Oracle**: to judge the success or failure of a test

## STLC â€“ Software Testing Life Cycle

Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a sequence of different activities performed by the testing team to ensure that the software product meets the quality standards. The phases are:

- **Requirement Analysis:** Testers are involved early on to understand the software's purpose, functionalities, and user needs. This helps identify potential testing areas and ensure requirements are clear and testable.
- **Test Planning:** A comprehensive plan is developed, outlining the testing strategy, scope, resources, schedule, and deliverables.
- **Test Case Design and Development:** Detailed test cases are designed based on requirements and test plans to validate specific functionalities.
- **Test Environment Setup:** The test environment is prepared to replicate the production environment, ensuring accurate test results.
- **Test Execution:** Test cases are executed, and results are documented to identify any discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes.
- **Defect Reporting and Tracking:** Any defects found are reported, and their resolution is tracked through to closure.
- **Test Closure:** Final test reports are generated, summarizing the testing process, results, and any lessons learned for future projects.

### Benefits of STLC:

- **Improved Software Quality:** STLC helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, leading to a more robust and reliable software product.
- **Reduced Development Costs:** Fixing bugs later in the development cycle is expensive. STLC helps catch issues early, saving time and resources.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** By ensuring the software meets user requirements, STLC contributes to a more positive user experience.

## Software Testing Methodology

#### Verification:

- Verification is the process of checking that software achieves its goal without any bugs.
- It is the process to ensure whether the product that is developed is right or not.
- It verifies whether the developed product fulfils the requirements that we have.
- Verification is **static** testing.

#### Validation:

- Validation is the process of checking whether the software product is up to the mark or in other words product has high-level requirements.
- It is the process of checking the validation of the product i.e. it checks what we are developing is the right product.
- It is validation of the actual and expected products.
- Validation is **dynamic** test.
