A problem in AI is a task or situation where a computer or machine needs to think, decide, or learn in order to solve something intelligently\r - A problem in AI is defined by: Inputs, a goal, and a way to reach that goal using logic, rules, or learning.\r - Example:\r \r   - Problem: A self-driving car reaching a destination safely.\r   - Inputs: Current location, Map data, Traffic signals, Nearby vehicles, Weather conditions\r   - Goal: Reach the destination safely, quickly, and without breaking any traffic rules.\r   - Way to reach the goal: Use AI to analyze surroundings, make decisions (like when to stop or turn), and learn from past drives to improve navigation.\r \r - AI problem components:\r \r   - Initial State – Starting point\r   - Goal State – What we want to achieve\r   - Actions – What can be done\r   - Transition Model – What happens when actions are taken\r   - Path Cost (optional) – How much each step costs (used in optimization)\r \r - Real-life examples:\r   - Diagnosing diseases from symptoms\r   - Translating languages (e.g., Google Translate)\r   - Recommending movies (e.g., Netflix)\r   - Detecting banking fraud\r \r | Problem Type*  | **Description**                            | *Example                       |\r | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |\r | Search problem    | Find the best solution from many options . | GPS finding the shortest route    |\r | Planning problems | Decide steps to reach a goal.              | Robot making tea                  |\r | Classification    | Group data into categories.                | Spam or Not Spam emails           |\r | Prediction        | Guess future results from past data.       | Weather forecasting               |\r | Decision making   | Pick the best option from choices.         | Chess AI choosing next move       |\r | Perception        | Understand inputs like images, sounds.     | Face recognition,<br>self-driving |\r | Learning problems | Learn from past experience to improve.     | Machine learning model training   |\r \r What does it mean to define AI Problem\r \r - In Artificial Intelligence, before solving a problem, we need to clearly define it — just like we need to understand the rules before playing a game\r - We define:\r \r   - Where we are (Initial State)\r   - Where we want to go (Goal State)\r   - What we can do (Possible Actions / Rules)\r \r - Example-1: Taxi Booking App (AI finding the best route)\r \r   - Initial State: Your current location\r   - Goal State: Your destination\r   - Actions: Choose among different routes, avoid traffic, follow navigation rules\r \r - Example-2: Cooking Assistant AI\r \r   - Initial State: Ingredients you have\r   - Goal State: Desired dish (e.g., pasta)\r   - Actions: Mix, boil, chop – in correct sequence\r \r - Example-3: Washing Clothes with AI Washing Machine\r   - Initial State: Dirty clothes in the basket\r   - Goal State: Clean, dry clothes\r   - Actions: Fill water, add detergent, wash, rinse, dry\r \r ---\r \r Problem Space & State Space\r \r - In AI, before solving any problem, we must clearly define what the problem is and how to approach it — that’s where problem space and state space come in.\r - Problem space and state space help AI understand: _\"Where can I go, what can I do, and how do I get to my goal efficiently?\"_\r \r State Space\r \r - All possible situations (states) the system can be in while solving the problem\r - It includes:\r   - The initial state\r   - The goal state\r   - All intermediate states you can reach by applying different actions\r \r Problem Space\r \r - Problem Space = The combination of: State Space + All possible actions (rules or moves that change one state to another)\r - Problem Space = State Space + Actions\r - It defines the entire environment in which the AI must operate to reach a goal.\r - It defines all possible steps AI can use to reach the goal\r \r Example\r \r - Making a burger: AI as a cooking assistant\r   - Imagine you're teaching a robot (AI) how to make a burger.\r   - Problem space = Every action AI can take (adding patty, adding cheese etc)\r   - State space = Every stage in burger-making\r   - Goal = Perfect burger\r \r ---\r \r Search Strategies\r \r - Search strategies help an AI find the path from the starting point to the goal, especially when the AI has many choices to make.\r - Imagine AI is playing a maze game, and it needs to find the quickest way out.\r - Search strategies guide how it explores the maze.\r - Two main types:\r   - Informed Search\r   - Uninformed Search\r \r | Informed*                  | *Uninformed                   |\r | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\r | Search with extra information | Search without an<br>information |\r | Uses knowledge to guide steps | No prior knowledge               |\r | Finds solution quickly        | Slower & time-consuming          |\r | Less complex (Time + Space)   | More complex (Time + Space)      |\r | Uses: DFS and BFS             | Uses `A*`, Heuri","semester":5},{"slug":"ai-03","title":"AI-03 Knowledge Representation","description":"","content":"Data, Information, and Knowledge\r \r Data – Raw Facts\r \r Definition: Data refers to raw, unprocessed, and unorganized facts.

An assignment statement associates the name to the left of the `=` symbol with the object denoted by expression to the right of the `=`.\r - Python variables name are case sensitive\r - There are small number of Reserved Keywords in python that have built in meanings and cannot be used as variable names.\r - E.g : def, del, elif, if, for, in, not, or etc\r \r IDLE\r \r - Typing programs directly into shell is inconvenient\r - Text editor is part of an IDE(Integrated Development Environment)\r - IDLE is IDE that comes as part of standard Python installation Package\r - IDLE provides\r   - A text editor with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and smart indentation\r   - A shell with syntax highlighting, and\r   - An integrated debugger\r   - When IDLE starts it will open a shell window into which you can type python commands\r - The file menu includes commands to\r - New editing window\r   - Open a file\r   - Save a File\r - Edit Menu\r   - Text editing command (e.g copy, paste)\r   - Shell, Debug, Options, Window\r \r Branching\r \r - Straight Line Programs:\r   - They execute one statement after another in the order in which they appear, and stop when they run out of statement\r - Branching Programs:\r   - The simplest branching statement is a conditional.\r - A conditional statement has 3 parts\r   - A test, i.e. an expression that evaluates to either True or False\r   - A block of code that is executed if the test evaluates to True\r   - An optional block of code that is executed if the test evaluates to False\r - After a conditional statement is executed, execution resumes at the code following the statement\r \r \r \r - Indentation is semantically meaningful in Python\r - For example: If the last statement in the above code were indented it would be part of block of code associated with else.\r - Nested Branching:\r   - A block of conditional statement contains other conditional statement is called Nested block\r \r \r \r Type STR & Input\r \r - Objects of type str are used to represent string of characters\r - Literals of type str can be written using either single or double quotes e.g. ‘`abc`’ or “`abc`”\r - `‘123’` is treated as string\r - Overloaded\r   - `+` and ``*` is overloaded.\r   - `3*4 =12`\r   - `3*’a’=aaa`\r   - `‘a’*’a`’` - Generates error, can’t multiply sequence by non-int\r - Indexing: Can be used to extract individual character from the string\r   - `‘abc’[0]`: a\r   - `‘abc’[2]`: c\r   - `‘abc’[3]`: Error\r   - `‘abc’[-1]`: c\r   - `‘abc’[-4]`: Error\r - Slicing: It is used to extract substring of arbitrary length.\r - Syntax: If s is a string then s`[start:end]`\r - Input: This function is used to get input directly from user.\r \r \r \r Iteration\r \r - Iteration in Python is the process of repeating a set of statements or code a specific number of times.\r - Like a conditional statement it begins with a test\r - If the test evaluates to True, the program executes the loop body once, and then goes back to re-evaluate the test.\r - This process is repeated until the test evaluates to False, after which control passes to the code following the iteration statement\r \r \r \r Control Structures\r \r - Most programs don't operate by carrying out a straightforward sequence of statements.\r - A code is written to allow making choices and several pathways through the program to be followed depending on shifts in variable values.\r - All programming languages contain a pre-included set of control structures that enable these control flows to execute, which makes it conceivable.\r - Types of Control Structures\r   - There are three types of control structures in Python:\r     - Sequential - The default working of a program. Sequential statements are a set of statements whose execution process happens in a sequence.\r     - Selection - This structure is used for making decisions by checking conditions and branching. For example, if, if-else, nested if, if-elif-else\r     - Repetition - This structure is used for looping, i.e., repeatedly executing a certain piece of a code block.

You can select all `<p>` elements on a page like this: `$(\"p\")`\r - When a user clicks on a button, all `<p>` elements will be hidden:\r \r \r \r #### The id Selector\r \r - The jQuery `#id` selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element.\r - An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the `#id` selector when you want to find a single, unique element.\r - To find an element with a specific id, write a hash character, followed by the id of the HTML element: `$(\"#test\")`\r - When a user clicks on a button, the element with id=\"test\" will be hidden:\r \r \r \r #### The Class Selector\r \r - The jQuery `.class` selector finds elements with a specific class.\r - To find elements with a specific class, write a period character, followed by the name of the class: `$(\".test\")`\r - When a user clicks on a button, the elements with class=\"test\" will be hidden:\r \r \r \r What are Events?\r \r - All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.\r - An event represents the precise moment when something happens.\r - The term \"fires/fired\" is often used with events.\r - Example: \"The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key\".\r \r Here are some common DOM events:\r \r - Mouse Events: `Click`, `Dblclick`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`\r - Keyboard Events: `keypress`, `keydown`,`keyup`\r - Form Events: `submit`, `change`, `focus`, `blur`\r - Document/Window Event: `load`, `resize`, `scroll`, `unload`\r \r #### jQuery Syntax For Event Methods\r \r - In jQuery, most DOM events have an equivalent jQuery method.\r - To assign a click event to all paragraphs on a page, you can do this: `$(\"p\").click();`\r - The next step is to define what should happen when the event fires.

There are two types of topology: Physical and Logical topology.\r \r Bus Topology\r \r \r \r - The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a Each node is either connected to the single cable known as a backbone cable.\r - Backbone cable by drop cable or directly connected to the backbone cable.\r - When a node wants to send a message over the network, it puts a message over the network.\r - All the stations available in the network will receive the message whether it has been addressed or not.\r - The bus topology is mainly used in 802.3* (Ethernet) and *802.4 standard networks.\r - The configuration of a bus topology is quite simpler as compared to other topologies.\r - The backbone cable is considered as a \"single lane\" through which the message is broadcast to all the stations.\r \r - Advantages:\r \r   - Low-cost cable: In bus topology, nodes are directly connected to the cable without passing through a hub. Therefore, the initial cost of installation is low.\r   - Moderate data speeds: Coaxial or twisted pair cables are mainly used in bus-based networks that support up to 10 Mbps.\r   - Familiar technology: Bus topology is a familiar technology as the installation and troubleshooting techniques are well known, and hardware components are easily available.\r   - Limited failure: A failure in one node will not have any effect on other nodes\r \r - Disadvantages:\r   - Extensive cabling: A bus topology is quite simpler, but still it requires a lot of cabling.\r   - Difficult troubleshooting: It requires specialized test equipment to determine the cable faults. If any fault occurs in the cable, then it would disrupt the communication for all the nodes.\r   - Signal interference: If two nodes send the messages simultaneously, then the signals of both the nodes collide with each other.\r   - Reconfiguration difficult: Adding new devices to the network would slow down the network.\r   - Attenuation: Attenuation is a loss of signal leads to communication issues. Repeaters are used to regenerate the signal.\r \r Ring Topology\r \r \r \r - In this topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with its exactly two neighbouring devices.\r - A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node.

Its main functions include:\r   - Framing (dividing bitstream into manageable units)\r   - Addressing (identifying sender & receiver)\r   - Error detection and correction\r   - Flow control\r   - Medium Access Control (MAC)\r \r Error detection and correction techniques\r \r - In computer networks, data integrity is essential.\r - As data travels across various channels, it can be susceptible to errors due to noise, interference, or other anomalies.\r - Error detection and correction techniques are vital in ensuring that the data received is accurate and reliable.\r - Understanding these concepts is essential for designing robust communication systems and maintaining the integrity of data transmission.\r \r What is Error Correction and Detection?\r \r - Error correction refers to techniques used to identify and correct errors in data transmission or storage without requiring retransmission of the data.\r - This process is crucial in ensuring data integrity, especially in environments where resending data is impractical or costly.\r - This allows the receiver to detect and fix errors that may have occurred during transmission.\r - Enabling error correction enhances the reliability of digital communication systems, ensuring that the information received is accurate and trustworthy\r - On the other hand, error detection refers to the methods and techniques used to identify errors that may occur during the transmission or storage of data.\r - The primary goal is to ensure that the data received matches what was originally sent.\r - Error detection identifies the presence of errors, it plays an important role in maintaining data integrity in communication systems.\r \r Types of Errors in Computer Networks\r \r - Single-Bit Error: This type of error occurs when one bit of a transmitted data unit is altered, leading to corrupted data.\r \r \r \r - Multiple-Bit Error: This type of error occurs when more than one bit is affected. While rarer than single-bit errors, they can occur in high-noise environments\r \r \r \r - Burst Error: This type of error occurs when a sequence of consecutive bits is flipped, resulting in several adjacent bits being incorrect.\r \r \r \r Error Detection Techniques\r \r - Parity Bits: A simple method that adds a single bit to data to ensure the total number of 1s is even (even parity) or odd (odd parity).\r \r \r \r - Checksums: A mathematical sum of data values calculated before transmission and verified at the destination. If the checksum doesn't match, an error is detected.\r \r \r \r - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): A more robust method that uses polynomial division to detect changes to raw data. CRCs are widely used in network communications and file storage\r \r \r \r - Checksums with Hash Functions: Advanced checksum methods use cryptographic hash functions (like SHA-256) to ensure data integrity, particularly in secure communications.\r \r Error Correction in Computer Networks\r \r - Once the errors are detected in the network, the deviated bits sequence needs to be replaced with the right bit sequence so that the receiver can accept the data and process it. This method is called Error Correction. We can correct the errors in the Network in two different ways which are listed below:\r   - Forward Error Correction: In this Error Correction Scenario, the receiving end is responsible for correcting the network error. There is no need for retransmission of the data from the sender’s side.\r   - Backward Error Correction: the sender is responsible for retransmitting the data if errors are detected by the receiver. The receiver signals the sender to resend the corrupted data or the entire message to ensure accurate delivery.\r - However, there is one of the most widely used Error Correction methods which is called ‘Hamming Code’ which was designed by R.W. Hamming. Let us have a quick look at it.\r \r Hamming Code Error Correction\r \r - n this method extra parity bits are appended to the message which are used by the receiver to correct the single bit error and multiple bit error.\r - Consider the below example to understand this method in a better way.\r - Suppose the sender wants to transmit the message whose bit representation is ‘1011001.’ In this message:\r   - Total number of bits (d) = 7\r   - Total of redundant bits (r) = 4 (This is because the message has four 1’s in it)\r   - Thus, total bits (d+r) = 7 + 4 = 11\r \r \r \r - Therefore, we have R1, R2, R3, and R4 as redundant bits which will be calculated according to the following rules:\r   - R1 includes all the positions whose binary representation has 1 in their least significant bit. Thus, R1 covers positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.\r   - R2 includes all the positions whose binary representation has 1 in the second position from the least significant bit.

An IP address definition is a numeric label assigned to devices that use the internet to communicate. Computers that communicate over the internet or via local networks share information to a specific location using IP addresses.\r - IP addresses have two distinct versions or standards. The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address is the older of the two, which has space for up to 4 billion IP addresses and is assigned to all computers. The more recent Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) has space for trillions of IP addresses, which accounts for the new breed of devices in addition to computers. There are also several types of IP addresses, including public, private, static, and dynamic IP addresses. Every device with an internet connection has an IP address, whether it's a computer, laptop, IoT device, or even toys. The IP addresses allow for the efficient transfer of data between two connected devices, allowing machines on different networks to talk to each other.\r \r How does an IP address work?\r \r - An IP address works in helping your device, whatever you are accessing the internet on, to find whatever data or content is located to allow for retrieval.\r - Common tasks for an IP address include both the identification of a host or a network, or identifying the location of a device. An IP address is not random. The creation of an IP address has the basis of math. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates the IP address and its creation. The full range of IP addresses can go from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.\r - With the mathematical assignment of an IP address, the unique identification to make a connection to a destination can be made.\r \r \r \r Public IP address\r \r - A public IP address, or external-facing IP address, applies to the main device people use to connect their business or home internet network to their internet service provider (ISP). In most cases, this will be the router. All devices that connect to a router communicate with other IP addresses using the router’s IP address.\r - Knowing an external-facing IP address is crucial for people to open ports used for online gaming, email and web servers, media streaming, and creating remote connections.\r \r Private IP address\r \r - A private IP address, or internal-facing IP address, is assigned by an office or home intranet (or local area network) to devices, or by the internet service provider (ISP). The home/office router manages the private IP addresses to the devices that connect to it from within that local network. Network devices are thus mapped from their private IP addresses to public IP addresses by the router.\r - Private IP addresses are reused across multiple networks, thus preserving valuable IPv4 address space and extending addressability beyond the simple limit of IPv4 addressing (4,294,967,296 or 2^32).\r - In the IPv6 addressing scheme, every possible device has its own unique identifier assigned by the ISP or primary network organization, which has a unique prefix. Private addressing is possible in IPv6, and when it's used it's called Unique Local Addressing (ULA).\r \r Static IP address\r \r - All public and private addresses are defined as static or dynamic. An IP address that a person manually configures and fixes to their device’s network is referred to as a static IP address. A static IP address cannot be changed automatically. An internet service provider may assign a static IP address to a user account. The same IP address will be assigned to that user for every session.\r \r Dynamic IP address\r \r - A dynamic IP address is automatically assigned to a network when a router is set up. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) assigns the distribution of this dynamic set of IP addresses. The DHCP can be the router that provides IP addresses to networks across a home or an organization.\r - Each time a user logs into the network, a fresh IP address is assigned from the pool of available (currently unassigned) IP addresses. A user may randomly cycle through several IP addresses across multiple sessions.\r \r What Is IPv4?\r \r - IPv4 is the fourth version of the IP. It is one of the core protocols of the standards-based methods used to interconnect the internet and other networks. The protocol was first deployed on the Atlantic Packet Satellite Network (SATNET), which was a satellite network that formed a segment of the initial stages of the internet, in 1982. It is still used to route most internet traffic despite the existence of IPv6.\r - IPv4 is currently assigned to all computers. An IPv4 address uses 32-bit binary numbers to form a unique IP address. It takes the format of four sets of numbers, each of which ranges from 0 to 255 and represents an eight-digit binary number, separated by a period point.\r \r IP Address Classes\r \r - Some IP addresses are reserved by the Intern","semester":5},{"slug":"cn-lm","title":"CN Lab Manual","description":"","content":"Practical 01\r \r Aim: Introduction to data Transmission in network.\r \r Exercise:\r \r 1.

Data mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data. The data sources can include databases, data warehouses, the Web, other information repositories, or data that are streamed into the system dynamically.\r - Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, trends, and valuable insights from large datasets using statistical and computational techniques. It involves analyzing raw data to extract meaningful information that can be used for decision-making, predictive modelling, and understanding complex phenomena\r \r ---\r \r Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD)\r \r - Data mining is considered as knowledge discovery from data, or KDD\r - Data mining is also considered as merely an essential step in the process of knowledge discovery.\r \r \r \r ---\r \r Knowledge Discovery Process\r \r 1.

Each table consists of a set of attributes (columns or fields) and usually stores a large set of tuples (records or rows)\r - When mining relational databases, we can go further by searching for trends or data patterns.\r - For example, data mining systems can analyze customer data to predict the credit risk of new customers based on their income, age, and previous credit information.\r - Data mining systems may also detect deviations—that is, items with sales that are far from those expected in comparison with the previous year. Such deviations can then be further investigated.\r - For example, data mining may discover that there has been a change in packaging of an item or a significant increase in price.\r - Relational databases are one of the most commonly available and richest information repositories, and thus they are a major data form in the study of data mining\r \r ---\r \r Data Warehouse\r \r - A data warehouse is a repository of information collected from multiple sources, stored under a unified schema, and usually residing at a single site.\r - Data warehouses are constructed via a process of data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, data loading, and periodic data refreshing.\r - To facilitate decision making, the data in a data warehouse are organized around major subjects (e.g., customer, item, supplier, and activity).\r - The data are stored to provide information from a historical perspective, such as in the past 6 to 12 months, and are typically summarized.\r - For example, rather than storing the details of each sales transaction, the data warehouse may store a summary of the transactions per item type for each store or, summarized to a higher level, for each sales region.\r - A data warehouse is usually modeled by a multidimensional data structure, called a data cube, in which each dimension corresponds to an attribute or a set of attributes in the schema, and each cell stores the value of some aggregate measure such as count\r \r ---\r \r Framework of Data Warehouse\r \r \r \r ---\r \r Transactional Data\r \r - In general, each record in a transactional database captures a transaction, such as a customer’s purchase, a flight booking, or a user’s clicks on a web page.\r - A transaction typically includes a unique transaction identity number (trans ID) and a list of the items making up the transaction, such as the items purchased in the transaction.\r - A transactional database may have additional tables, which contain other information related to the transactions, such as item description, information about the salesperson or the branch, and so on\r \r | Trans ID | list_of_items_IDs |\r | -------- | ----------------- |\r | T100     | 11, 13, 18, 116   |\r | T200     | 12, 18            |\r | ...

There may be technology limitations such as limited buffer size for coordinating synchronized data transfer and consumption.\r     - Incorrect data may also result from inconsistencies in naming conventions or data codes, or inconsistent formats for input fields (e.g., date).\r     - Duplicate tuples also require data cleaning.\r \r ---\r \r Major Tasks in Data Cleaning\r \r - Data Cleaning: Fill in the missing value, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.\r - Data Integration: Integration of multiple databases, data cubes or files\r - Data Transformation: Normalization and Aggregation\r - Data Reduction: Obtains reduced representation in volume but produces the same or similar analytical results.\r - Data Discretization: Part of data reduction but with particular importance especially for numeric data\r \r ---\r \r Data Cleaning\r \r - Dirty data can cause confusion for the mining procedure, resulting in unreliable output.\r - Therefore useful pre-processing step is to run your data through some data cleaning routines.\r - Data Cleaning routines work to “clean” the data by:\r   - Filling in missing values,\r   - Smoothing noisy data,\r   - Identifying or removing outlier and\r   - Resolving inconsistencies.\r - Real-world data tend to be incomplete, noisy, and inconsistent.\r \r Missing Values\r \r - Imagine that you need to analyse all Electronics sales and customer data.\r - You note that many tuples have no recorded value for several attributes such as customer income.\r - How can you go about filling in the missing values for this attribute?\r   - Ignore the tuple:\r     - This is usually done when the class label is missing (assuming the mining task involves classification)\r     - This method is not very effective, unless the tuple contains several attributes with missing values.\r   - Fill in the missing value manually:\r     - This approach is time consuming and may not be feasible given a large data set with many missing values.\r   - Use a global constant to fill in the missing value:\r     - Replace all missing attribute values by the same constant such as a label like “`Unknown`” or `−∞`.\r     - But, if missing values are replaced by, say, “Unknown,” then the mining program may mistakenly think that they form an interesting concept, since they all have a value in common—that of “Unknown”.\r     - Although this method is simple, it is not fool proof\r   - Use a measure of central tendency for the attribute (e.g., the mean or median) to fill in the missing value:\r     - For normal (symmetric) data distributions, the mean can be used, while skewed data distribution should employ the median.\r     - Normal data forms a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve, where the mean, median, and mode are all equal and situated at the center.\r     - Skewed data, on the other hand, is asymmetrical, with one \"tail\" extending further than the other, indicating a non-equal distribution around the center\r   - Use the most probable value to fill in the missing value:\r     - This  may  be  determined  with  regression, inference- based  tools  using  a  Bayesian formalism, or decision tree.\r   - Use the attribute mean or median for all samples belonging to the same class as the given tuple:\r     - For example, if classifying customers according to credit risk, we may replace the missing value with the mean income value for customers in the same credit risk category as that of the given tuple. If the data distribution for a given class is skewed, the median value is a better choice.\r \r Noisy Data\r \r - Noise: Random error or variance in a measured variable\r - Incorrect attribute values may be due to:\r   - Faulty data collection instruments\r   - Data entry problem\r   - Data Transmission Problem\r   - Technology limitation\r   - Inconsistency in naming convention (H.Shree, HShree)\r \r How to Handle Noisy Data?\r \r \r \r - Binning:\r   - Binnin","semester":5},{"slug":"dwdm-03","title":"DWDM-03 Data Warehouse","description":"","content":"Data Warehouse\r \r - A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data in support of management’s decision making process.\r - The four keywords—subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile—distinguish data warehouses from other data repository systems, such as relational database systems, transaction processing systems, and file systems.\r \r ---\r \r Key Features of a Data Warehouse\r \r A data warehouse is a centralized repository of integrated data collected from different sources. It is designed to support decision-making processes by providing historical, subject-oriented, and consistent information.\r \r Subject-Oriented\r \r - A data warehouse is organized around major subjects such as customers, suppliers, products, and sales.\r - Unlike operational systems that focus on day-to-day transaction processing, the data warehouse emphasizes modeling and analysis of data for decision-makers.\r - It provides a concise and simplified view of specific subject areas by excluding irrelevant or unnecessary data.\r - Example: Instead of storing every transaction detail, the warehouse may summarize customer purchasing behavior over time.\r \r Integrated\r \r - A data warehouse is built by integrating data from multiple heterogeneous sources, such as:\r   - Relational databases\r   - Flat files\r   - Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems\r - Data cleaning* and *data integration techniques ensure consistency in:\r   - Naming conventions\r   - Encoding structures\r   - Attribute measurements\r - Example: If one system stores gender as \"M/F\" and another as \"Male/Female,\" the warehouse integrates them into a consistent format.\r \r Time-Variant\r \r - A data warehouse stores data over a long time horizon (typically 5–10 years or more).\r - Historical data provides trends and patterns that are crucial for forecasting, strategic planning, and decision-making.\r - Every key structure (tables, records, attributes) in the warehouse contains a time dimension, either explicitly (timestamps, date fields) or implicitly.\r - Example: Sales data can be analyzed by year, quarter, month, or week to identify seasonal patterns.\r \r Non-Volatile\r \r - A data warehouse is a separate data store, distinct from operational databases.\r - Once entered, data is generally not updated or deleted; instead, it is appended with new historical data.\r - Because of this non-volatile nature, the warehouse does not require:\r   - Transaction processing\r   - Recovery mechanisms\r   - Concurrency control\r - Only two main operations are performed:\r   - Initial data loading (bulk data transfer from sources)\r   - Data access/retrieval (queries and analysis)\r - This ensures stable, reliable data for decision support.\r \r ---\r \r Differences between Operational Database Systems and Data Warehouse\r \r OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)\r \r - OLTP systems* are database systems designed to manage and support *transaction-oriented applications in real-time.\r - Their main role is to perform day-to-day business operations such as sales, banking, payroll, and reservations.\r - The major task of online operational database systems is to perform online transaction and query processing.\r \r #### Key Features of OLTP\r \r 1. Transaction-Oriented\r    - Handles a large number of short, simple transactions.\r    - Example: ATM withdrawal, product purchase, student registration.\r 2. Real-Time Processing\r    - Transactions are processed immediately to keep the database up to date.\r 3. Concurrency Control\r    - Many users can perform transactions simultaneously without conflict.\r 4. Current Data\r    - Maintains up-to-date operational data.\r 5. Normalized Database Design\r    - Data is highly normalized to avoid redundancy and ensure consistency.\r 6.

Listening is the ability to accurately receive and interpret messages in the communication process.\r - Listening is key to all effective communication. Without the ability to listen effectively, messages are easily misunderstood.\r - As a result, communication breaks down and the sender of the message can easily become frustrated or irritated.\r - Listening is receiving language through the ears.\r - Listening involves identifying the sounds of speech and processing them into words and sentences.\r - When we listen, we use our ears to receive individual sounds (letters, stress, rhythm and pauses) and we use our brain to convert these into messages that mean something to us.\r - Listening in any language requires focus and attention.\r - It is a skill that some people need to work at harder than others.\r - People who have difficulty concentrating are typically poor listeners.\r - Listening in a second language requires even greater focus.\r - Listening is so important that many top employers provide listening skills training for their employees. This is not surprising when you consider that good listening skills can lead to better customer satisfaction, greater productivity with fewer mistakes, and increased sharing of information that in turn can lead to more creative and innovative work.\r \r Barriers to Listening\r \r Physiological Barriers:\r \r - Some people may have genuine hearing problems or deficiencies that prevent them from listening properly. It can be treated.\r - Some people may have problem in processing information or retaining information in the memory. For example Lack of concentration/interest.\r \r Physical Barriers:\r \r - These referred to distraction in the environment such as the sound of an air conditioner, cigarette smoke, or an overheated room. It can interfere the Listening process.\r - They could also be in the form of information overload.\r - For example, if you are in meeting with your manager and the phone rings and your mobile beeps at the same time to let u know that you have the message. It is very hard to listen carefully to what is being said. Arriving late for a speech, presentation or lecture.\r - Therefore unavailability of listeners, Speaker or listener being distracted by disturbances will also be coming into physical barrier category.\r \r Attitudinal Barriers:\r \r - Pre occupation with personal or work related problems can make it difficult to focus one’s attention completely on what speaker is saying, even what is being said is of very importance.\r - Another common attitudinal barrier is egocentrism, or the belief that the person has more knowledgeable than the speaker, or that there is nothing new to learn from the speaker’s ideas.\r - People with this kind of close minded attitude are very poor listeners.\r \r Wrong Assumptions:\r \r - The success of communication depend on the both the sender and receiver.\r - It is wrong to assume that communication is the sole responsibility of the sender or the speaker and those listeners have no role to play. Such an assumption can be big barrier to listening.\r - For example, a brilliant speech or presentation, however well delivered, is wasted if the receiver is not listening at the other end.\r - Listeners have as much responsibility as speakers to make the communication successful. The process should be made successful by paying attention seeking clarifications and giving feedback.\r - Another example: Assuming that the speaker is going to give some unimportant information or Pre-judgments about the speaker.\r \r Cultural Barriers:\r \r - Accents can be barriers to listening, since they interfere with the ability to understand the meaning of words that are pronounced differently.\r - The problem of different accents arises not only between cultures, but also within a culture.\r - For example, in a country like India where there is enormous cultural diversity, accents may differ even between regions states.\r \r Gender Barriers:\r \r - Communication research has shown that gender can be barrier to listening.\r - Studies have revealed that men and women listen very differently and for different purposes.\r - Women are more likely to listen for the emotion behind a speaker’s words, when men listen more for the facts and the content.\r \r Lack of Training:\r \r - Listening is not an inborn skill. People are not born good listeners. It is developed through practice and training.\r - Lack of training in listing skills is an important barrier.\r - In lack of training people do avoid listening to difficult, boring or complex information and selectively listen only to what is considered interesting.\r \r Bad Listening Habits:\r \r - Most people are very average listeners who have developed poor listening habits that are hard to say and that act as barriers to listening.\r - For example, some people have the habits of “faking” attention, or trying to look like a listeners, in order to impress the speaker and to assure him that they are paying attention.\r - Others may te","semester":2},{"slug":"ECS-03","title":"ECS-03 Professional Communication","description":"","content":"Resume Building\r \r Building a resume is an essential skill for faculty members to teach their students.

This feature allows us to change or update the code are reflected as soon as the alterations are made.\r - It provides the smoother and seamless scrolling experiences of using the app without much hangs or cuts, which makes running applications faster in comparison to other mobile app development frameworks.\r - Flutter reduces the time and efforts of testing. As we know, flutter apps are cross-platform so that testers do not always need to run the same set of tests on different platforms for the same app.\r - It has an excellent user interface because it uses a design-centric widget, high-development tools, advanced APIs, and many more features.\r - It is similar to a reactive framework where the developers do not need to update the UI content manually.\r - It is suitable for MVP (Minimum Viable Product) apps because of its speedy development process and cross-platform nature.\r \r Disadvantages of Flutter\r \r - The Flutter is a comparatively new language that needs continuous integration support through the maintenance of scripts.\r - It provides very limited access to SDK libraries. It means a developer does not have a lot of functionalities to create a mobile application. Such types of functionalities need to be developed by the Flutter developer themselves.\r - It uses Dart programming for coding, so a developer needs to learn new technologies. However, it is easy to learn for developers.\r \r Flutter Installation in Windows\r \r - System Requirements:\r   - Operating System: Windows 7 or Later (You can also use Mac or Linux OS.).\r   - Disk Space: 400 MB (It does not include disk space for IDE/tools).\r   - Windows PowerShell\r   - Git for Windows\r   - SDK: Flutter SDK for Windows\r   - IDE: Android Studio (Official)\r - Install Git:\r   - Step-01: To download Git\r   - Step-02: Run the `.exe` file to complete the installation.

They are like small pieces of a puzzle that you put together to make a complete picture.\r \r \r \r Lifecycle of a StatefulWidget\r \r - In Flutter, a StatefulWidget is a widget that can change its state during its lifetime. This means it can rebuild itself multiple times, reflecting changes in its internal state or external data. Understanding the lifecycle of a StatefulWidget is crucial for managing resources, performing actions at the right time, and ensuring optimal performance. The lifecycle of a StatefulWidget involves the following stages:\r \r 1. `createState()`\r    1. Purpose: This method is the first step in the lifecycle. It is called when the StatefulWidget is created. It returns an instance of the State class associated with the StatefulWidget .\r    2. Key Point: This method is called only once.\r \r \r \r 2. `initState()`\r    - Purpose: This method is called once when the State object is inserted into the widget tree. It is used for initializing any data or state the widget needs. For example, initializing variables, setting up streams, or starting animations.\r    - Key Point: Always call `super.initState()` to ensure the parent class is also initialized properly.\r \r \r \r 3. `didChangeDependencies() `\r    - Purpose: This method is called immediately after `initState()` and whenever the widget’s dependencies change. Dependencies can change if the widget depends on an `InheritedWidget` that itself changes.\r    - Key Point: Useful for actions that depend on the context or inherited widgets.\r \r \r \r 4. `build()`\r    - Purpose: This method is called whenever the widget is to be rendered. It is responsible for constructing the widget tree, which represents the UI. The `build()` method can be called multiple times during the widget's lifecycle, especially after calling `setState()`.\r    - Key Point: The UI is built based on the current state, so changes in state will trigger a rebuild.\r \r \r \r 5. `setState()`\r    - Purpose: This method is used to notify the framework that the internal state of this object has changed. When called, it triggers a rebuild of the widget, ensuring that the UI reflects the updated state.\r    - Key Point: Use this method responsibly to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.\r \r \r \r 6. `dispose()`\r    - Purpose: This method is called when the State object is permanently removed from the widget tree. It is used for final cleanup, such as canceling timers, closing streams, or disposing of controllers.\r    - Key Point: After `dispose()` , the widget is no longer active, and its State object is considered dead.\r \r \r \r Types of Design System\r \r Material Design\r \r - Material Design is a design language developed by Google. It is used primarily for Android apps but has become popular across various platforms due to its clean, modern aesthetics and usability principles. Material Design provides a consistent look and feel with a set of guidelines and components.\r \r Key Principles of Material Design:\r \r 1. Material Metaphor: Material Design is based on the metaphor of physical materials like paper and ink. It uses shadows, depth, and responsive animations to mimic how real-world materials behave.\r 2. Bold, Graphic, Intentional: Emphasis on bold colors, large typography, and meaningful use of space. It aims for clarity and impact.\r 3. Motion Provides Meaning: Motion in Material Design is used to provide context and meaning. For example, transitions and animations help users understand the relationship between different elements.\r \r Cupertino Design\r \r - Cupertino Design is a design language developed by Apple for iOS. It aims to create a user experience that aligns with iOS conventions and aesthetics. Cupertino widgets provide a native iOS look and feel.\r \r Key Principles of Cupertino Design:\r \r 1. Consistency with iOS: Cupertino widgets adhere to the design guidelines set by Apple for iOS apps, ensuring that apps have a consistent look and feel with native iOS applications.\r 2. Flat and Minimalistic: Cupertino design tends to use flat, minimalistic elements without the elevated effects seen in Material Design.\r 3. Native Feel: Cupertino widgets are styled to feel native on iOS, using iOS-specific patterns, colors, and interactions.\r \r Row Widget\r \r - The `Row` widget in Flutter is used to display its children widgets in a horizontal array. It arranges its children in a single horizontal line, which can be useful for creating layouts where you want elements to be aligned side-by-side.\r \r Key Properties of the `Row` Widget\r \r 1. children: A list of widgets that are arranged horizontally. These can be any widget, such as Text , Icon , Container , etc.\r 2. mainAxisAlignment: Defines how the children are aligned along the horizontal axis (main axis).

Expanded : Expands a child widget to fill available space in the parent\r \r \r \r Multiple Child Widgets\r \r Multiple Child Widgets can contain more than one child. These widgets are often used to create complex layouts by arranging multiple widgets in a specific order or alignment.\r \r 1. Column : Arranges its children in a vertical direction.\r \r \r \r 2. Row : Arranges its children in a horizontal direction.\r \r \r \r 3. Stack : Places its children on top of each other, allowing for overlap.\r \r \r \r 4. ListView : A scrollable list of widgets arranged in a linear fashion (either vertical or horizontal).\r \r \r \r 5. GridView : A scrollable, 2D array of widgets arranged in rows and columns.\r \r \r \r 6. Wrap : Wraps its children into a vertical or horizontal flow, breaking lines as necessary.\r \r \r \r 7. Flex : A widget that arranges its children in a one-dimensional array (similar to Row and Column but more customizable).\r \r \r \r Conclusion\r \r - Single Child Widgets are used when you need to modify or layout a single widget.\r - Multiple Child Widgets are used for more complex layouts that involve arranging multiple widgets in different patterns or directions.\r \r Advanced Layout Application\r \r In this section, let us learn how to create a complex user interface of product listing with custom design using both single and multiple child layout widgets.\r \r For this purpose, follow the sequence given below:\r \r - Create a new Flutter application in VS Code, store_app.\r - Replace the main.dart code with following code:\r \r \r \r - Here, We have created MyHomePage widget by extending StatelessWidget instead of default StatefulWidget and then removed the relevant code.\r - Now, create a new widget, ProductBox according to the specified design as shown below\r \r \r \r \r \r - Please observe the following in the code:\r   - ProductBox has used four arguments as specified below:\r     - name - Product name\r     - description - Product description\r     - price - Price of the product\r     - image - Image of the product\r   - ProductBox uses seven build-in widgets as specified below:\r     - Container Expanded Row Column Card Text\r - ProductBox is designed using the above mentioned widget. The arrangement or hierarchy of the widget is specified in the diagram shown below\r \r \r \r - Now, place some dummy image (see below) for product information in the assets folder of the application and configure the assets folder in the pubspec.yaml file as shown below\r - Definition images in pubspec.yam\r - Finally, Use the ProductBox widget in the MyHomePage widget as specified below:\r \r \r \r - Here,we have used ProductBox as children of ListView widget.\r - The complete code (main.dart) of the product layout application (store_app) is as follows:\r \r \r \r Gestures\r \r In Flutter, gestures are a way to detect and respond to user interactions like taps, swipes, and drags. Flutter provides a robust system to handle gestures, making it easy to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. The primary widget used for handling gestures in Flutter is the `GestureDetector` .\r \r Key Concepts of Gestures\r \r - `GestureDetector`: The `GestureDetector` widget is used to capture a wide range of gestures. It wraps around another widget and intercepts gestures like taps, double taps, long presses, swipes, and more.\r - Common Gestures:\r   - Tap: A single quick press.\r   - Double Tap: Two quick presses in succession.\r   - Long Press: A press that lasts for more than a second.\r   - Swipe: A quick drag motion in a particular direction.\r   - Drag: A press followed by movement.\r - Using `GestureDetector`: The `GestureDetector` widget has properties like `onTap` , `onDoubleTap` , `onLongPress` , `onPanUpdate` , and others, each corresponding to a specific gesture.\r \r Example\r \r Let's create a simple example where a container changes its color when the user taps on it\r \r \r \r - Here The `GestureDetector` wraps a Container widget. The `onTap` callback is used to change the color of the container when the user taps on it.\r - The `_changeColor` method is called when the container is tapped, toggling its color between blue and red.\r \r Advanced Gestures\r \r 1. Drag Gesture: You can detect dragging using the `onPanUpdate` callback. This is useful for interactive elements like sliders or custom scroll views.\r \r \r \r 2. Swipe Gesture: Detecting swipes involves using `onHorizontalDragEnd` or `onVerticalDragEnd` callbacks.

Nowadays The term Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerged the popular terms.\r - The IoT is not just limited to the connected or networked devices, but in a broad way IoT devices exchange meaningful information from one device to another to get desire result.\r - The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, actuators, software, and connectivity technology, enabling them to collect, exchange, and act upon data with minimal human intervention.\r - In simpler terms, IoT involves connecting everyday objects to the internet and enabling them to communicate and interact with each other and with humans.\r - IoT is not a single technology, it’s a combination of technologies and domain knowledge.\r - As a result, engineers from different domains have to work together for building a complete IoT product.\r - Life would be governed entirely by Internet and IoT in the near future.\r \r Definition of IoT\r \r - IoT is network of interconnected computing devices which are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.\r - A dynamic global network infrastructure with self configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocols where physical and virtual ―things have identities, physical attributes and virtual personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into information network, often communicate data associated with users and their environments.\r \r Overview of IoT\r \r - First of all we should discuss about the name “IoT – Internet of Things” in detail\r - What is Internet?\r   - In simple word, it’s a Network of Networks or Interconnected LANs.\r \r Characteristics of IoT\r \r Connectivity & Networking\r \r - Connectivity is an important requirement of the IoT infrastructure.\r - Things of IoT should be connected to the IoT infrastructure.\r - Anyone, anywhere, anytime can connect, this should be guaranteed at all times.\r \r Scalability\r \r - The number of elements connected to the IoT zone is increasing day by day.\r - The IoT setup should be capable of handling the massive expansion.\r - It can be either expand capability in terms of processing power, Storage, etc as vertical scaling or horizontal scaling by multiplying with easy cloning.\r \r Dynamic and Self-Adapting (Complexity)\r \r - This is achieved through dynamic changes that occur in the environment around these devices.\r - An AC should have a sensor that can send a signal to the cloud and adjust it to the premises of the place.\r - Similarly, the camera can easily click photographs by adjusting to light situations, like day and night.\r \r Architecture\r \r - The architecture of IoT is designed in a way that it is capable of supporting various devices, technologies, and protocols.\r -

Model: Represents the database structure. It is used to query, add, or update data in the database.\r       1. Handles the data in the application.\r       2. It communicates with the database and stores or retrieves data.\r       3. Example: Storing user information, products, or blog posts.\r   2.  View: Contains the business logic and interacts with the model to fetch data and pass it to the template.\r       1. Manages the logic and processes user requests.\r       2. It fetches data from the Model and passes it to the Template.\r       3. Example: When a user requests a webpage, the View gets the required data and sends it for display.\r   3.  Template: Handles the presentation layer by rendering HTML pages based on the data passed from the view.\r       1. Manages the presentation layer.\r       2. Defines how the data will look on the webpage using HTML and CSS.\r       3. Example: Displaying a user profile with their name, photo, and posts.\r \r Flow of MVT (Model-View-Template)\r \r 1. User Request: The client (user) sends an HTTP request (GET or POST) to the Django application.\r 2. URL Dispatcher: The request is routed to the appropriate view function based on the URL pattern defined in the urls.py file.\r 3. View: The view function processes the request. It interacts with the model to fetch data or perform logic.\r 4. Template: The data fetched by the view is passed to a template for rendering as an HTML page.\r 5. Response: The template is sent back to the user as a response.\r \r Advantages of MVT Model\r \r - Separation of Concerns: Data, logic, and presentation are handled separately.\r - Reusability: Templates and Models can be reused across different parts of the application.\r - Scalability: Easy to maintain and extend for larger applications.\r \r Installation in Virtualenv\r \r - Virtualenv creates an isolated Python environment to avoid dependency conflicts between projects.\r \r 1.

An essential element of object-oriented programming is abstraction.\r - Humans manage complexity through abstraction.\r - For example, people do not think of a car as a set of tens of thousands of individual parts.\r - They think of it as a well-defined object with its own unique behaviour\r - This abstraction allows people to use a car to drive to the grocery store without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the parts that form the car.\r - They can ignore the details of how the engine, transmission, and braking systems work.\r - Instead, they are free to utilize the object as a whole.\r \r Encapsulation\r \r - Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.\r - One way to think about encapsulation is as a protective wrapper that prevents the code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper.\r - Access to the code and data inside the wrapper is tightly controlled through a well-defined interface.\r - To relate this to the real world, consider the automatic transmission on an automobile.\r - It encapsulates hundreds of bits of information about your engine, such as how much you are accelerating, the pitch of the surface you are on, and the position of the shift lever.\r - You, as the user, have only one method of affecting this complex encapsulation: by moving the gear-shift lever.\r - You can't affect the transmission by using the turn signal or windshield wipers, for example.\r - Thus, the gear-shift lever is a well-defined (indeed, unique) interface to the transmission.\r - Further, what occurs inside the transmission does not affect objects outside the transmission.\r - For example, shifting gears does not turn on the headlights!\r \r Inheritance\r \r - Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object.\r - This is important because it supports the concept of hierarchical (that is, top-down) classification.\r - For example, a Golden Retriever is part of the classification dog, which in turn is part of the mammal class, which is under the larger class animal.\r - Without the use of hierarchies, each object would need to define all of its characteristics explicitly.\r - However, by use of inheritance, an object need only define those qualities that make it unique within its class.\r - It can inherit its general attributes from its parent.\r - Thus, it is the inheritance mechanism that makes it possible for one object to be a specific instance of a more general case.\r \r Polymorphism\r \r - Polymorphism (from the Greek, meaning \"many forms\") is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.\r - The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.\r - Extending the dog analogy, a dog's sense of smell is polymorphic. If the dog smells a cat, it will bark and run after it. If the dog smells its food, it will salivate and run to its bowl. The same sense of smell is at work in both situations.\r - The difference is what is being smelled, that is, the type of data being operated upon by the dog's nose! This same general concept can be implemented in Java as it applies to methods within a Java program.\r \r JAVA Essentials\r \r Syntax:\r \r - The core topics for Java syntax include:\r   - What is an Object\r   - What is a Class\r   - What is a variable\r   - What is a method\r   - `System.out.println()` method\r   - Primitive types\r   - String\r   - Basic arithmetic and logical operators\r   - if-else statement\r   - Loop statements\r   - Arrays\r \r Object Oriented Programming:\r \r - Java programming is mostly about object oriented.\r - This is the reason when you are starting out with Java, you must have a good understanding of OOP.\r - This won’t be difficult to learn, but it involves a lot of practice.\r - Begin by understanding what an object is, how diverse attributes can be and how these are presented in Java.\r \r Collection Framework:\r \r - It offers an architecture to collect and exploit groups of objects.\r - By utilising collections you can perform specific data operations such as modification, insertion, deletion, etc.\r - Knowledge of collection is considered crucial for interviews as well as live projects.\r - Often during an interview, you will be required to steer through collections and their features.\r \r Exceptions:\r \r - It is an unusual situation, but you should learn about them and it is not that complex.\r - It is a great way for simplifying bug detection and widely used by Java programmers.\r \r Generics:\r \r - Generics facilitate an alternative to rigid definitions of the types of use. At first you won’t find this topic complicated. The more grasp you have on this the better you will be able to code.\r \r Multithreading:\r \r - This can be difficult to learn for beginners. However, it is not considered an essential topic to master especially during interviews.

And if method return integer value then the type of method is an integer\r \r \r \r Method Overloading\r \r - Method overloading means method name will be same but each method should be different parameter list.\r \r \r \r Passing Object as Parameter\r \r \r \r - We have defined a method “take2” that declares an object named obj as parameter. We have passed ob to our method. The method “take2” automatically gets 3,7 as values for n and n2\r \r Static Fields and Methods\r \r - A static data field does not belong to any one object\r - Also called a class variable\r - Only one instance of the variable exists for all instances of the class\r - Note that a static data field is not a constant (final)\r - All instances of the class reference that one variable\r \r - Consider the need of a method that does not belong to an object of any type\r   - Examples\r   - A method to find the max or min of two or more numbers\r   - A square root method\r - When specified static, a method is still a member of the class\r   - However, does not need an object as a prefix to the call\r - Call with the name of the class\r   - `int maximum = Math.max(2, 3);`\r   - `double root = Math.sqrt(4.2);`\r \r `this` keyword in Java\r \r - `this` is a reference variable that refers to the current object.\r \r \r \r Array\r \r \r \r - Array is collection of related data items\r - Declaring an Array:\r   - Do not have to create an array while declaring array variable\r   - `<type> [ ] variable_name;`\r   - `Double[ ] myList;`\r   - `double myList[ ];`\r - Both syntaxes are equivalent\r - No memory allocation at this point\r \r - Defining an Array:\r   - `variable_name=new <type>[arraySize];`\r   - `Number = new int[5];`\r   - `Mylist = new int[10];`\r   - It creates an array using new `dataType[arraySize];`\r   - It assigns the reference of the newly created array to the variable `variable_name`\r   - `dataType array_name[ ] = {list of values};`\r   - `Int a [ ]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,};`\r   - Array index starts from 0 to arraySize-1\r \r Array Size Through Input\r \r \r \r Example\r \r \r \r Reusing Array Variable\r \r `\r \r \r \r Array Length\r \r - Refer to array length using `length()` method\r - If number of elements in the array are changed, JAVA will automatically change the length attribute!\r \r \r \r \r \r 2 Dimensional Array\r \r - Representing 2D arrays\r   - `Int myarray[][];`\r   - `Myarray = new int[3][4];`\r   - `Int myarray [][] = new int[3][4];`\r - Example\r   - `Int myarray[2][3]={0,0,0,1,1,1};` 2 columns and 3 rows\r \r for-each Loop\r \r - The Java for-each loop or enhanced for loop is introduced since J2SE 5.0.\r - It provides an alternative approach to traverse the array or collection in Java.\r - It is mainly used to traverse the array or collection elements.\r - The advantage of the for-each loop is that it eliminates the possibility of bugs and makes the code more readable.\r - It is known as the for-each loop because it traverses each element one by one.\r - The Java for-each loop traverses the array or collection until the last element. For each element, it stores the element in the variable and executes the body of the for-each loop.\r - Syntax\r \r \r \r Passing Array to the Method\r \r - Arrays can be passed to other methods just like how you pass primitive data type’s arguments.\r - To pass an array as an argument to a method, you just have to pass the name of the array without square brackets.\r - The method prototype should match to accept the argument of the array type.\r   `void method_name (int [] array);`\r - This means `method_name` will accept an array parameter of type `int`. So if you have an int array named `myarray`, then you can call the above method as follows: `method_name (myarray);`\r \r How to Return an Array\r \r - Apart from all the primitive types that you can return from Java programs, you can also return references to arrays.\r - While returning a reference to an array from a method, you should keep in mind that:\r - The data type that returns value should be specified as the array of the appropriate data type.\r - The returned value from a method is the reference to the array.\r - The array is returned from a method in the cases where you need to return multiple values of the same type from a method.\r - This approach becomes useful as Java doesn’t allow returning multiple values.\r \r Command Line Argument\r \r - The java command-line argument is an argument i.e. passed at the time of running the java program.\r - The arguments passed from the console can be received in the java program and it can be ","semester":3},{"slug":"java-03","title":"Java-03","description":"","content":"Packages\r \r - Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces.\r - Packages are used for:\r   - Preventing naming conflicts. For example there can be two classes with name Employee in two packages, `college.staff.cse.Employee` and `college.staff.ee.Employee`\r   - Making searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier\r   - Providing controlled access: protected and default have package level access control. A protected member is accessible by classes in the same package and its subclasses. A default member (without any access specifier) is accessible by classes in the same package only.\r   - Packages can be considered as data encapsulation (or data-hiding).\r \r Creating Package\r \r - Creating a package in Java is a way to organize your classes and interfaces into namespaces, making it easier to manage and locate them within your project. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a package:\r \r 1. Choose a Package Name:\r    1. A package name should be unique and follow the standard Java naming conventions (e.g., `com.company.project`).\r 2. Create a Directory Structure:\r    1. Packages are represented by directories in the file system. The directory structure should reflect the package hierarchy.\r    2. For example, if your package name is `com.company.project`, create a directory structure` com/company/project/`.\r 3. Place Your Java Files:\r    1. Within the directory corresponding to your package (`com/company/project/`), place your Java source files (.java files).\r    2. Every Java file in the package should start with a package statement indicating its package name\r    3. Example package statement for a class in package `com.company.project`:\r \r \r \r 4. Compile Your Java Files:\r    1. Compile your Java files using the javac command. Make sure you are in the root directory of your source files (where com/ directory is located).\r    2. Example: `javac com/company/project/MyClass.java`\r \r Using Packages\r \r Using packages in Java involves importing classes from other packages into your Java source files so that you can utilize their functionality. Here’s a step\u0002-by-step guide on how to use packages in Java:\r \r - Importing Packages:\r   - To use classes from another package, you need to import them using the `import` statement at the beginning of your Java file.\r   - There are different ways to import classes:\r     - Import a single class. Example: `import packageName.ClassName;`\r     - Import all classes in a package (not recommended due to potential naming conflicts). Example: `import packageName.*;`\r     - Import a static member.\r     - Example: `import static packageName.ClassName.staticMember;`\r - Using Classes from Imported Packages:\r   - Once imported, you can use the classes and their members (fields, methods) directly in your Java code\r \r Example\r \r Suppose you have a package `com.company.project` with a class `MyClass`, and you want to use it in another class Main:\r \r - Directory Structure: Ensure your directory structure reflects the package hierarchy, as described earlier\r - `MyClass.java`: Define `MyClass` inside `com.company.project`\r \r \r \r - `Main.java`: Import `MyClass` and use it in Main\r \r \r \r - Compile and Run: Compile both `MyClass.java` and `Main.java` (from the root directory containing `com/`)\r \r \r \r - Output:\r \r \r \r [!Important]\r >\r - Package Naming: Ensure package names follow Java's naming conventions (`com.company.project`).\r - Import Statements: Always place `import` statements at the beginning of your Java file, before any class definitions.\r - Class Usage: Once imported, classes from other packages can be instantiated and their methods invoked like any other class in your project\r \r String Class\r \r - Strings are the type of objects that can store the character of values and in Java, every character is stored in 16 bits i.e. using UTF 16-bit encoding.\r - A string acts the same as an array of characters in Java\r - Ways of creating String:\r   - There are two ways to create a string in Java:\r   - String Literal\r     - Example:` String demoString = “Ankit”;`\r   - Using New Keyword:\r     - Example: `String demoString = new String (“GeeksforGeeks”);`\r \r String Methods\r \r - `int length()`\r   - Returns the number of characters in the String.\r   - `\"Ankit\".length(); // returns 5`\r - `Char charAt(int i)`\r   - Returns the character at i<sup>th</sup> index.\r   - `\"Ankit\".charAt(3); // returns ‘i’`\r - `String substring(int i)`\r   - Return the substring from the i<sup>th</sup> index character to end.\r   - `\"Helloworld\".substring(3); // returns “oworld”`\r - `String substring(int i, int j)`\r   - Returns the substring from i to j-1 index\r   - `\"Helloworld\".substring(2,5); // returns “llo”`\r - `String concat(String str)`\r   - Concatenates specified string to the end of this string.\r \r \r \r - `String toLowerCase()`\r   - Converts all the characters in the String to lower\r \r \r \r - `String toUpperCase()`\r   - Converts all the cha","semester":3},{"slug":"java-04","title":"Java-04 Multithreading and Applet","description":"","content":"Multithreading\r \r - Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.\r - A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.\r - Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.\r - However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area.\r - They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context \u0002switching between the threads takes less time than process.\r - Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.\r - Advantages of Java Multithreading:\r   - It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.\r   - You can perform many operations together, so it saves time\r   - Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.\r - java.fang.Thread:\r   - Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.\r   - Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.\r   - Threads can be created by using two mechanisms:\r     - Extending the Thread class\r     - Implementing the Runnable Interface\r - Thread creation by extending the Thread class:\r   - We create a class that extends the `java.lang.Thread` class.\r   - This class overrides the `run()` method available in the Thread class.\r   - A thread begins its life inside `run()` method.\r   - We create an object of our new class and call `start()` method to start the execution of a thread. `start()` invokes the `run()` method on the Thread object.\r \r \r \r - Thread creation by implementing the Runnable Interface:\r   - We create a new class which implements `java.lang.Runnable` interface and override `run()` method.\r   - Then we instantiate a Thread object and call `start()` method on this object.\r \r \r \r #### Thread Class vs Runnable Interface\r \r 1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.\r 2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like `yield()`, `interrupt()` etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.\r 3. Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.\r \r Main Thread\r \r - Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming. A multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently.\r - Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.\r - When a Java program starts up, one thread begins running immediately.\r - This is usually called the main thread of our program because it is the one that is executed when our program begins.\r - There are certain properties associated with the main thread which are as follows:\r - It is the thread from which other “child” threads will be spawned.\r - Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions\r \r \r \r How to control Main thread\r \r - The main thread is created automatically when our program is started.\r - To control it we must obtain a reference to it.\r - This can be done by calling the method `currentThread()` which is present in Thread class.\r - This method returns a reference to the thread on which it is called.\r - The default priority of Main thread is 5 and for all remaining user threads priority will be inherited from parent to child.\r \r \r \r Creation of new Threads\r \r - In Java, you can create a thread by either extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.\r - There are two ways to create a thread:\r   - By extending Thread class\r   - By implementing Runnable interface.\r - Commonly used Constructors of Thread class:\r   - `Thread()`\r   - `Thread(String name)`\r   - `Thread(Runnable r)`\r   - `Thread(Runnable r,String name)`\r \r Commonly used methods of Thread class\r \r 1. `public void run()`: is used to perform action for a thread.\r 2. `public void start()`: starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method on the thread.\r 3. `public void sleep(long miliseconds)`: Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified number of milliseconds.\r 4. `public void join()`: waits for a thread to die.\r 5. `public void join(long miliseconds)`: waits for a thread to die for the specified miliseconds.\r 6. `public int getPriority()`: returns the priority of the thread.\r 7. `public int setPriority(int priority)`: changes the priority of the thread.\r 8. `public String getName()`: returns the name of the thread.\r 9. `public void setName(String name)`: changes the name of the thread.\r 10. `public Thread currentThread()`: returns the reference of currently executing thread.\r 11. `public int getId(","semester":3},{"slug":"Java-LM","title":"Java Lab Manual","description":"","content":"Experiment: 01\r \r Aim: Write a Java program to evaluate simple interest given the principal, rate, and time.\r \r Description: From this practical, students will learn how to take user inputs and calculate results.\r \r Procedure: Write a Java program to calculate simple interest by taking inputs for principal, rate, and time.\r \r Code:\r \r \r \r Conclusion: In this experiment, students learned how to accept user inputs and calculate simple interest using basic arithmetic operations.

Schema: Fixed schema (predefined structure).\r - Query Language: Uses SQL (Structured Query Language).\r - Scalability: Primarily vertical scaling (upgrading hardware).\r - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\r - Use Cases: Financial systems, customer relationship management, and inventory management where data consistency is crucial.\r \r NoSQL Database\r \r - Structure: Data is stored in various forms, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns.\r - Schema: Flexible or schema-less, no fixed structure.\r - Query Language: Depends on the database type (e.g., MongoDB uses query methods; Cassandra uses CQL).\r - Scalability: Primarily horizontal scaling (adding more servers).\r - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, Neo4j.\r - Use Cases: Big data, real-time applications, social networks, content management systems, and when handling unstructured or semi-structured data.\r \r NewSQL Database\r \r - Structure: Combines relational database structures with the scalability of NoSQL.\r - Schema: Uses relational models but supports high scalability.\r - Query Language: SQL, similar to traditional RDBMS, but with additional features for scalability.\r - Scalability: Horizontal scaling like NoSQL but with ACID compliance.\r - Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB, NuoDB.\r - Use Cases: Applications that require the scalability of NoSQL but still need the ACID compliance of relational databases, such as cloud-based applications and large-scale web services.\r \r Differences\r \r | Feature*         | **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**                      | *NoSQL (Not Only SQL)                                                 |\r | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r | Data Structure  | Table-based (rows and columns)                                         | Document, key-value, graph, or column-based                              |\r | Schema          | Fixed schema (tables with predefined columns)                          | Flexible schema (schema-less or dynamic)                                 |\r | Query Language  | SQL (Structured Query Language)                                        | Varies (e.g., MongoDB uses BSON, Cassandra uses CQL)                     |\r | Scalability     | Vertical scaling (adding more power to a single server)                | Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)                                 |\r | ACID Compliance | Fully ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)   | May or may not be ACID compliant (Eventual consistency is common)        |\r | Data Integrity  | Strong data integrity and consistency                                  | Eventual consistency, often favors performance over consistency          |\r | Transactions    | Supports complex transactions with multiple operations                 | Limited support for transactions (varies by system)                      |\r | Performance     | Slower with large data volumes, especially in distributed environments | High performance, especially with large datasets and distributed systems |\r | Use Cases       | Suitable for structured data, banking systems, ERP, CRM                | Suitable for big data, real-time apps, social networks, IoT              |\r | Examples        | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Serve","semester":4},{"slug":"mdb-02","title":"MDB-02 Data Modelling","description":"","content":"Key Features of MongoDB\r \r - Schema-less design allows you to store data in JSON-like format.\r - Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, making it efficient for big data.\r - High Performance: Designed for fast reads and writes with indexes and in memory capabilities.\r - Replication: Provides data redundancy and high availability\r \r Documents\r \r - Documents in MongoDB are the primary unit of storage, and each document is represented as a BSON object.\r - A document contains key-value pairs and can store complex data types like arrays and embedded documents.\r - The `_id` field is a unique identifier automatically generated for each document\r \r \r \r Collection\r \r - A collection is like a whole notebook that holds many pages (documents) about a specific topic.\r - In MongoDB, documents that are similar are grouped together in a collection.\r - Example: You might have a collection called \"Pets\" that contains all the documents for each of your pets\r \r Schema Design\r \r - MongoDB allows you to store data without a fixed schema, meaning documents in a collection can have different structures.\r - Schema Design Considerations:\r   - Denormalization: Embed related data in a single document. This improves performance when reading, but increases the document size.\r   - Normalization: Store data in separate collections and link them using references. This reduces redundancy but may lead to more complex queries.\r   - Performance: Design schemas to optimize query performance based on read and write patterns.\r \r Embedded Documents\r \r - In embedding, the related data is stored within the same document as a nested structure.\r - Use this approach when data is closely related and usually accessed together.\r - Advantages: Faster read operations, simpler schema.\r \r \r \r References\r \r - Use when data is large, or there is a many-to-one* or *many-to-many relationship.\r - In referencing, related data is stored in separate documents, and a reference (usually an `_id`) is used to link them\r - Advantages: Avoids document duplication and reduces storage requirements.\r \r \r \r - Here, the `address_id` in the student's document references the `_id` of the address document in the Addresses collection. To get the complete information about a student, you would need to join or query both collections.\r \r Embedded vs References\r \r | Aspect           | Embedding                            | Referencing                     |\r | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\r | Srtucture        | Nested data within the same document | Related data stored separately  |\r | Performance      | Faster reads, fewer queries          | Slower reads due to joins       |\r | Data Duplication | May lead to duplication              | Reduces duplication             |\r | Flexibility      | Harder to u date shared data         | Easier to update shared<br>data |\r | Use Case         | Simple, closely related data         | Complex, reusable data          |\r \r MongoDb Data Structures\r \r - Database: A container for collections.\r - Collection: A group of documents, equivalent to a table in relational databases.\r - Document: A set of key-value pairs, analogous to a row in relational databases. Documents are stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format\r \r Querying MongoDB\r \r - MongoDB Query Language (MQL) allows you to query collections in a rich and flexible manner.\r \r \r \r - The query returns documents that match the specified criteria.\r \r Comparison Operator\r \r - `$eq`: Matches values that are equal to a specified value.\r \r \r \r - `$ne`: Matches values that are not equal.\r \r \r \r - `$gt`: Matches values greater than a specified value.\r \r \r \r - `$l`t: Matches values less than a specified value.\r \r \r \r - `$gte`: Matches values greater than or equal to.\r \r \r \r - `$lte`: Matches values less than or equal to\r \r \r \r - `$in`: Allows you to match documents where a field’s value is within a specified array\r \r \r \r - `$nin`: Selects those documents where the field value is not equal to any of the given values in the array and the field that does not exist.\r \r \r \r Logical Operator\r \r - `$and`: Joins query clauses with a logical AND\r \r \r \r - `$or`: Joins query clauses with a logical OR\r \r \r \r - `$not`: Inverts the effect of a query expression.\r \r \r \r - `$nor`: Joins query clauses with a logical NOR.\r \r \r \r - `distinct`\r \r \r \r Element Operator\r \r - `$exists`: Matches documents that have the specified field.\r \r \r \r - `$type`: Selects documents if a field is of the specified type.\r \r \r \r Projection Operator\r \r - Retrieve only the name and age fields for all documents.\r \r \r \r - Exclude the address field from the results\r \r \r \r - By default, MongoDB includes the `_id` field.

A common feature of objects is that methods are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields\r - C++, Java, Dot Net, Python etc are the example of OOP.\r \r POP vs OOP\r \r | Procedure Oriented Programming (POP)                                                                           | Object Oriented Programming (OOP)                                                                                                |\r | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r | Emphasis is on doing things not on data, means it is function driven                                           | Emphasis is on data rather than procedure, means object driven                                                                   |\r | Main focus is on the function and procedures that operate on data                                              | Main focus is on the data that is being operated                                                                                 |\r | Top Down approach in program design                                                                            | Bottom Up approach in program design                                                                                             |\r | Large programs are divided into rams known as functions                                                        | Large programs are divided into classes and objects                                                                              |\r | Most of the functions share global data                                                                        | Data is structured together with function in the data.                                                                           |\r | Data moves openly in the system from one function to another function                                          | Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions                                                                      |\r | Adding of data and function is difficult                                                                       | Adding of data and function is easy                                                                                              |\r | We cannot declare namespace directly                                                                           | We can use namespace directly, Ex: using namespace std;                                                                          |\r | Concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, data encapsulation, abstraction, access specifiers are not available. | Concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, data encapsulation, abstraction, access specifiers are available and can be used easily |\r | Examples: C, Fortran, Pascal, etc                                                                              | Examples: C++, Java, C#, etc                                                                                                     |\r \r ##### POP vs OOP (short)\r \r | Procedure Oriented Programming (POP)                   | Object Oriented Programming (OOP)                   |\r | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |\r | Structure oriented                                     | Object oriented                                     |\r | Program is divided into functions.                     | Program is divided into objects.                    |\r | Top-down approach                                      | Bottom-up approach                                  |\r | Inheritance is not allowed.                            | Inheritance property is used.                       |\r | It doesn’t use access specifier.                       | It uses access specifier.                           |\r | No data hiding.                                        | Encapsulation is used to hide the data.             |\r | No virtual function                                    | Concept of virtual function                         |\r | Parts of program are linked through parameter passing. | Object functions are linked through message passing |\r | Expanding new data and functions is not easy           | Adding new data and functions is easy               |\r | Not suitable for solving big problems.                 | Used for solving big problems.                      |\r | C, Pascal                                              | C++, Java                                           |","semester":2},{"slug":"OOPC-02","title":"OOPC-02 Function & Constructor","description":"","content":"Function\r \r - A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.\r - You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.\r - Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.\r - Predefined Function: Library functions such as main()\r - User-Defined Functions: Defined by users\r \r #### Syntax\r \r \r \r Calling a Function\r \r - Declared functions are not executed immediately, they will be executed later, when they are called\r - To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon\r - A function can be called multiple times\r \r \r \r \r \r Function Declaration & Definition\r \r - A function consists of two parts:\r   - Declaration: the return type, the name of the function, and parameters (if any)\r   - Definition: the body of the function (code to be executed)\r \r If a user-defined function, such as myFunction() is declared after the main() function, an error will occur:\r \r Instead you can have function declaration above main(), and function definition below main().\r \r \r \r \r \r Parameters & Arguments\r \r - Information can be passed to functions as a parameter.\r - Parameters act asvariables inside the function\r - Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.\r - You can add as many parameters as you want\r \r \r \r - Here fname is Parameter\r - When a parameter is passed to the function, it is called an argument.\r \r \r \r \r \r - Here, Dipesh and Nilesh is Arguments\r \r Default Parameters\r \r - You can also use a default parameter value, by using the equals sign (=)\r - If we call the function without an argument, it will use the default value\r \r \r \r \r \r A parameter with a default value, is often known as an \"optional parameter\".\r \r Multiple Parameters\r \r - When you are working with multiple parameters, the function call must have the same number of arguments as there are parameters, and the arguments must be passed in the same order.\r \r \r \r \r \r Call by Value\r \r - In call by value, original value is not modified.\r - The function receives a copy of the actual parameter values passed to it\r - Any changes made to the parameters inside the function do not affect the original variables in the calling function\r - The function works with its own local copies of the variables\r \r \r \r \r \r Call by Reference\r \r - In this method function receives a reference to the actual variable rather than a copy of its value\r - function can directly modify the original variable's value\r - Any changes made inside the function are reflected in the variable in the calling function.\r \r \r \r \r \r Inline Function\r \r - An inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is called\r - When the inline function is called whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of the inline function call.\r - An inline function may increase efficiency if it is small.\r   Syntax\r \r \r \r Inlining is only a request to the compiler, not a command. The compiler can ignore the request for inlining.\r \r \r \r Static Data Member\r \r - The static keyword is used with a variable to make the memory of the variable static once a static variable is declared its memory can’t be changed\r - Static members of a class are not associated with the objects of the class\r - Once a static member is declared it will be treated as same for all the objects associated with the class\r \r \r \r Static Member Function\r \r - Static Member Function in a class is the function that is declared as static because of which function attains certain properties:\r   1.  A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist\r   2.  A static member function can also be accessed using the class name through the scope resolution operator.\r   3.  A static member function can access static data members and static member functions inside or outside of the class\r   4.  Static member functions have a scope inside the class and cannot access the current object pointer\r   5.  You can also use a static member function to determine how many objects of the class have been created\r \r \r \r \r \r #### Why we need Static Member Function\r \r - Static members are frequently used to store information that is shared by all objects in a class.\r - For instance, you may keep track of the quantity of newly generated objects of a specific class type using a static data member as a counter. This static data member can be increased each time an object is generated to keep track of the overall number of objects.\r \r Friend Function\r \r - A Friend Function is a function that can access and use the protected and private data of a class\r - By using the keyword friend compiler knows the given function is a friend function\r - For accessing the data, the declaration of a friend function should be done inside the body of a class starting with the keyword friend\r   Syntax\r \r \r \r #### Characteristics of Friend Function\r \r - The function is not in the scope ","semester":2},{"slug":"OOPC-03","title":"OOPC-03 Inheritance","description":"","content":"- In Inheritance new classes are created from the existing classes.\r - The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”.\r - The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.\r - The derived class inherits all the properties of the base class, without changing the properties of base class and may add new features to its own.\r - These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class.\r - Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Subclass or Derived Class.\r - Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by a subclass is called Base Class or Superclass.\r \r Implementation\r \r \r \r Modes of Inheritance\r \r - Public Mode:\r   - If we derive a subclass from a public base class.\r   - Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.\r - Protected Mode:\r   - If we derive a subclass from a Protected base class.\r   - Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.\r - Private Mode:\r   - If we derive a subclass from a Private base class.\r   - Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become Private in the derived class\r \r The private members in the base class cannot be directly accessed in the derived class, while protected members can be directly accessed.\r \r \r \r \r \r Types of Inheritance\r \r - 5 types:\r   - Single inheritance\r   - Multilevel inheritance\r   - Multiple inheritance\r   - Hierarchical inheritance\r   - Hybrid inheritance\r \r Single Inheritance\r \r - In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class.\r - I.e. one subclass is inherited by one base class only.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Multiple Inheritance\r \r - Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one class.\r - I.e. one subclass is inherited from more than one base class.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Multilevel Inheritance\r \r - In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Hierarchical Inheritance\r \r - In this type of inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class.\r - I.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance\r \r - Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance.\r - For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Anomaly of Inheritance\r \r - In multiple inheritances, when one class is derived from two or more base classes then there may be a possibility that the base classes have functions with the same name, and the derived class may not have functions with that name as those of its base classes.\r - If the derived class object needs to access one of the similarly named member functions of the base classes then it results in ambiguity because the compiler gets confused about which base’s class member function should be called.\r \r \r \r - In this example, derived class C inherited the two base classes A and B having the same function name func().\r - When the object of class C is created and called the function func() then the compiler gets confused that which base class member function func() should be called.\r - To solve this ambiguity scope resolution operator is used denoted by ‘ :: ‘\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Abstract Class\r \r - Abstract classes act as expressions of general concepts from which more specific classes can be derived.\r - You can't create an object of an abstract class type.\r - However, you can use pointers and references to abstract class types.\r - You create an abstract class by declaring at least one pure virtual member function.\r - That's a virtual function declared by using the pure specifier (= 0) syntax.\r - Classes derived from the abstract class must implement the pure virtual function or they, too, are abstract classes\r \r \r \r Restriction on Abstract Classes\r \r - Abstract classes can't be used for:\r   - Variables or member data\r   - Argument types\r   - Function return types\r   - Types of explicit conversions\r \r Questions\r \r 1.

In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics.\r A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behaviour in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming\r \r Types of Polymorphism:\r \r - Compile-time Polymorphism\r - Runtime Polymorphism\r \r \r \r Compile Time Polymorphism\r \r - This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overloading* or *Operator Overloading.\r \r Function Overloading\r \r - When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters, then the functions are said to be overloaded, hence this is known as Function Overloading.\r - Functions can be overloaded by changing the number of arguments or/and changing the type of arguments.\r - In simple terms, it is a feature of object-oriented programming providing many functions that have the same name but distinct parameters when numerous tasks are listed under one function name.\r - The advantage of Function overloading is that it increases the readability of the program because you don't need to use different names for the same action.\r - There are certain Rules of Function Overloading that should be followed while overloading a function.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Operator Overloading\r \r - C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as Operator Overloading.\r - The advantage of Operators overloading is to perform different operations on the same operand\r - For example, we can make use of the addition operator (+) for string class to concatenate two strings. We know that the task of this operator is to add two operands. So a single operator ‘+’, when placed between integer operands, adds them and when placed between string operands, concatenates them.\r \r \r \r - Operator functions are the same as normal functions.\r - The only differences are, that the name of an operator function is always the operator keyword followed by the symbol of the operator, and operator functions are called when the corresponding operator is used.\r \r - Almost all operators can be overloaded except a few. Following is the list of operators that cannot be overloaded:\r   `sizeof` `typeid` `Scope resolution (::)` `Class member access operators (.(dot), .* (pointer to member operator))` `Ternary or conditional (?:)`\r \r #### Rules for Operator Overloading\r \r - Existing operators can only be overloaded, but the new operators cannot be overloaded.\r - The overloaded operator contains at least one operand of the user-defined data type.\r - We cannot use friend function to overload certain operators. However, the member function can be used to overload those operators.\r - When unary operators are overloaded through a member function take no explicit arguments, but, if they are overloaded by a friend function, takes one argument.\r - When binary operators are overloaded through a member function takes one explicit argument, and if they are overloaded through a friend function takes two explicit arguments.\r \r #### Unary Operator overloading\r \r - In the unary operator function, no arguments should be passed.\r - It works only with one class object. It is the overloading of an operator operating on a single operand\r \r \r \r \r \r - We can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +.\r \r \r \r \r \r #### Binary Operator Overloading\r \r - An operator which contains two operands to perform a mathematical operation is called the Binary Operator Overloading.\r - In the binary operator overloading function, there should be one argument to be passed.\r - It is the overloading of an operator operating on two operands\r - It is a polymorphic compile technique where a single operator can perform various functionalities by taking two operands from the programmer or user.\r - There are multiple binary operators like `+, -, *, / `etc., that can directly manipulate or overload the object of a class.\r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r Example of plus(+) and Minus(-) binary operator overloading:\r \r \r \r \r \r Runtime Polymorphism\r \r Function Overriding\r \r - It takes place when your derived class and base class both contain a function having the same name.\r - Along with the same name, both the functions should have the same number of arguments as well as the same return type.\r - The derived class inherits the member functions and data members from its base class.\r - So to override a certain functionality, you must perform function overriding. It is achieved during the run time.\r - Functions that are overridden acquire different scopes.\r - For function overriding, inheritance* is a must.

This offers flexibility to the user as to where he should be during the course of his routine.\r - Instant and Multiple Access:\r   - Many users can access the same information at the same time.\r   - Immediate commands such as printing commands can be made with the help of computer networks.\r \r Disadvantages\r \r - Lack of data security and privacy:\r   - Because there would be a huge number of people who would be using a computer network to get and share some of their files and resources, a certain user’s security would be always at risk.\r   - There might even be illegal activities that would occur, which you need to be careful about and aware of\r - Presence of computer viruses and malware:\r   - If even one computer on a network gets affected by a virus, there is a possible threat for the other systems getting affected too.\r   - Viruses can spread on a network easily, because of the inter- connectivity of workstations.\r   - Moreover, multiple systems with common resources are the perfect breeding ground for viruses that multiply\r - Lack of Independence:\r   - Since most networks have a centralized server and dependent clients, the client users lack any freedom whatsoever.\r   - Centralized decision making can sometimes hinder how a client user wants to use his own computer.\r - Lack of Robustness:\r   - As previously stated, if a computer network’s main server breaks down, the entire system would become useless.\r   - Also, if it has a bridging device or a central linking server that fails, the entire network would also come to a standstill.\r - Need an efficient handler:\r   - For a computer network to work efficiently and optimally, it requires high technical skills and know-how of its operations and administration.\r   - A person just having basic skills cannot do this job. Take note that the responsibility to handle such a system is high, as allotting permissions and passwords can be daunting.\r   - Similarly, network configuration and connection is very tedious and cannot be done by an average technician who does not have advanced knowledge.\r \r Applications\r \r - Financial Services:\r   - Nowadays, almost all the financial services depend on the computer network.\r   - You can access the financial services across the world.\r   - For example, a user can transfer money from one place to another by using the electronic fund transfer feature.\r   - You can use networking in various financial areas such as ATM, foreign exchange and credit history search.\r - Business:\r   - Nowadays, most of the works of businesses are done over the computers.\r   - To exchange the data and ideas, you need an effective data and resources sharing features.\r   - To do this, you need to connect the computer with each other through a network.\r   - For example, a person of one department of an organization can share or access the electronic data of other department through network\r - Email Services:\r   - A computer ","semester":2},{"slug":"PCMT-04","title":"PCMT-04 Transmission Media & OSI Model","description":"","content":"Transmission Media\r \r \r \r - A transmission media can be defined as anything that can carry information from a source to a destination.\r - On the basis of transmission of data, the transmission media can be classified in to two categories:\r   - Guided (Physical) transmission media\r   - Unguided (Wireless) transmission media\r \r Guided Transmission Media\r \r - Guided media are those that provide a channel from one device to another.\r - The three Guided (Physical) media commonly used for data transmission are:\r \r - Twisted Pair* - A twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires, typically about 1 mm thick. - The wires are twisted together in a helical form, just like a DNA molecule. - Twisting is done because two parallel wires constitute a fine antenna. - When the wires are twisted, the waves from different twists cancel out, so the wire radiates less effectively. - *Why cable is twisted? - If the two wires are parallel, the effect of these unwanted signals is not the same in both wires because they are at different locations relatives to the noise or crosstalk sources. - This results in a difference at the receiver. - By twisting the pair, a balance is maintained.\r \r \r \r - Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP): - UTP is made up of two insulated copper wires twisted around one another. - This cable can block interference and does not require a physical shield for this purpose. - It is employed in telephonic applications.\r \r \r \r - Shielded twisted-pair (STP):\r   - STP cable has a metal foil or braided mesh covering that encases each pair of insulated conductors.\r   - Metal casing improves the quality of cable by preventing the penetration of noise or crosstalk.\r   - It is bulkier and more expensive.\r - Application:\r   - Used in telephone lines to provide voice and data channels.\r   - The DSL lines uses by telephone companies use the high-bandwidth capability of UTP cables.\r   - LANs, such as 10Base-T, 100Base-T also uses twisted-pair cables\r \r \r \r - Coaxial Cable:\r   - It has better shielding than twisted pairs, so it can span longer distances at higher speeds.\r   - Two kinds of coaxial cable are widely used. One kind is 50-ohm cable which is commonly used when it is intended for digital transmission from the start.\r   - The other kind is 75-ohm cable which is commonly used for analogue transmission and cable television but is becoming more important with the advent of Internet over cable.\r   - A coaxial cable consists of a stiff copper wire as the core surrounded by an insulating material.\r   - The insulator is encased by a cylindrical conductor, often as a closely-woven braided mesh.\r   - The outer conductor is covered in a protective plastic sheath.\r   - The construction and shielding of the coaxial cable give it a good combination of high bandwidth and excellent noise immunity.\r   - The bandwidth possible depends on the cable quality, length and signal-to-noise ratio of the data signal. Modern cables have a bandwidth of close to 1 GHz.\r   - Coaxial cables used is widely used within the telephone system for long-distance lines but have now largely been replaced by fibre optics on long-haul routes\r \r \r \r - Fibre Optics:\r   - A fibre-optic cable is made of glass or plastic and transmits signals in the form of light\r   - Optical fibres use reflection to guide light through a channel.\r   - A glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of less dense glass or plastic.\r   - The difference in density of the two materials must be such that a beam of light moving through a core is reflected off the cladding instead of being refracted into it.\r   - Fibre optic cables are similar to coax, except without the braid.\r   - At the centre is the glass core through which the light propagates.\r   - The core is surrounded by a glass cladding with a lower index of refraction than the core, to keep all the light in the core.\r   - Next comes a thin plastic jacket to protect the cladding.\r   - Fibres are typically grouped in bundles, protected by an outer sheath.\r \r Unguided Transmission Media\r \r - Unguided media transport electromagnetic waves without using a physical conductor.\r - This type of communication is often referred to as wireless communication.\r \r \r \r - Radio Transmission:\r   - Radio waves are easy to generate, can travel long distances, and can penetrate buildings easily, so they are widely used for communication, both indoors and outdoors.\r   - Radio waves also are unidirectional, meaning that they travel in all directions from the source, so the transmitter and receiver do not have to be carefully aligned physically.\r   - The properties of radio waves are frequency dependent.\r   - At low frequencies, radio waves pass through obstacles well, but the power falls off sharply with distance from the source, roughly as 1/r2 in air.\r   - At high frequencies, radio waves tend to travel in straight lines and bounce off obstacles. They are also absorbed by rain.\r   - At all frequencies, radio waves are subject to interferenc","semester":2},{"slug":"php-01","title":"PHP-01 Introduction","description":"","content":"- PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language.

PHP started as a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts called \"Personal Home Page Tools\" to track visits to his online resume.\r - 1995: PHP 1.0 Released Rasmus released PHP Tools publicly to help developers build dynamic web pages.\r - 1997: PHP/FI2.0 Gained popularity in the web community. Supported MySQL, and basic database operations. Began to be used on a larger scale for server-side scripting.\r - 1998: PHP3.0 Renamed to “PHP: Hypertext Pre-processors” (recursive acronym). Added modular architecture and support for more databases. Marked the beginning of PHP's global popularity.\r - 2023–2024: PHP8.3and Upcoming 8.4 Enhanced performance, bug fixes, and stability improvements. Preparing for PHP 9 (expected to drop support for legacy features).\r \r Features Merits and Demerits of PHP\r \r - Open Source: Freely available and supported by a large community.\r - Server-Side Scripting: Executes on the server and sends HTML to the client.\r - Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on major operating systems: Windows, Linux, macOS.\r - Database Integration*: *Supports many databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc.).\r - Embedded in HTML: PHP code can be embedded directly into HTML code.\r - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Supports OOP principles, making it scalable and maintainable.\r - Security Features: Offers features like data encryption and hashing for secure web development.\r - Fast Load Time and Execution: Generally fast compared to interpreted languages like Python or Ruby.\r - Built-in Support for Web Services: Supports protocols like HTTP, FTP, and can handle JSON, XML, etc.\r - Security Issues: PHP is open-source, so vulnerabilities are well known, and if not coded properly, it may lead to security threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\r - Not Suitable for Large Applications: PHP is not ideal for very large or complex applications, as it can become difficult to manage and maintain at scale.\r - Performance for Large-Scale Apps: Compared to languages like Java or C#, PHP may lag in performance for CPU-intensive or real-time applications.\r - Too Flexible: While flexibility is a strength, PHP allows poor coding practices, making it harder to enforce standards across teams.\r \r General Structure of PHP\r \r - All PHP code must be inside `<?php...?>` tags. The PHP engine interprets code inside these tags.\r - Each PHP statement must end with a semicolon.\r - PHP can be embedded (mixed up) with HTML. It’s very easy to write php code in HTML anywhere by starting and ending php tag in between HTML.

Easy to learn and Use:\r    - It has a simple structure, a few keywords, and clearly straightforward defined syntax.\r    - There is no use of the semicolon or curly-brackets for defining scope in Python.\r    - Its indentation (spaces or tabs) defines the block of code.\r    - Therefore, Python programs are easy to read and understand.\r 2. Expressive Language:\r    - Python (like Perl) is an expressive language. Its syntax is very easy.\r    - We can perform complex tasks by writing a few lines of code in Python as compared to other programming language.\r 3. Interpreted Language:\r    - Python is an interpreted based language similar to Perl and PHP.\r    - It means its script code is executed one line at a time and not all at once, like in other programming languages. The line-by-line execution makes it easy to debugging the Python code.\r    - Python has also a built-in debugging feature.\r    - Beside it, Python is not a fully compiled language.\r    - The code is automatically compiled into the machine readable byte codes and then executed.\r 4. Cross-platform Language:\r    - Python is a cross-platform language, which means it is platform independent. We can run the Python code equally on different platforms, such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc.\r    - This is because the source code of python first is converted to a machine readable byte code, which is then interpreted.\r 5. Free and Open Source:\r    - Python is a free and open-source programming language. It is freely available for everyone. We can install it on our computer free of cost on any operating system with no copyright issues.\r 6. Object-Oriented Language:\r    - Python supports object-oriented style of programming (OOP) that encapsulates the code within objects.\r    - OOP is a modern programming paradigm that is based on the concepts of classes and objects.\r    - It breaks up the code into several segments that messages back and forth using classes.\r    - Object-oriented programming supports inheritance, polymorphism, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.\r    - Its procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop powerful applications in less code with a good level of abstraction.\r 7. Interactive:\r    - Python is really interactive, so we can write a program directly on the Python prompt.\r    - The advantage of being Python interactive is we can interact directly with the interpreter and get the immediate results.\r    - We can also use the prompt to test out small bits of codes to see if they work\r 8. Easy to Maintain:\r    - We can easily maintain the source code of Python programming language.\r 9. Extensible Feature:\r    - We can integrate Python with other languages such as C, C++, and Java.\r    - It allows us to execute the code written in other programming languages. This implies that we can compile the code in other languages like C/C++, or Java, and then can use that in our python code, which we can compile and run anywhere\r 10. High-Level Language:\r     - Python is a high-level programming language, which means it enables the programmer to write programs that are not specific to a particular type of computer or designed for a specific task.\r     - A high-level programming language is easier to write and understand.\r     - Programmers can easily write and understand or interpret the code.\r     - It is closer to human language and far to machine language.\r     - For a computer to understand and run a program designed with a high-level language, we must compile it into machine language.\r 11. Broad Standard Library:\r     - One of the main reasons for Python's popularity is its large standard library for the various fields such as machine learning, data science, web developer, and also for the scripting.\r     - Python contains a rich set of modules and functions that are cross-platform.\r     - Web Development Libraries: Django, Flask, Bottle, Tornado, Pyramid, web2py, CherryPy, CubicWeb\r     - GUI Development Libraries: Tkinter, Libavg, PyGObject, PySimpleGUI, PyQt, PySide, Kivy, wxPython, PyForms\r     - Scientific and Numeric Libraries: SciPy, Numpy, Pandas, IPython, TensorFlow, Seaborn, Matplotlib\r 12.

Indexing starts at 0 in Python.\r \r \r \r String Slicing and Joining\r \r - String slicing allows you to extract a substring from a string. It uses the syntax `string[start:end:step]`.\r \r \r \r String Methods\r \r - Python provides many built-in methods for manipulating strings, such as `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, etc.\r \r \r \r Formatting Strings\r \r - String formatting allows you to interpolate variables and expressions within strings. Python supports multiple ways of string formatting, including f-strings, `str.format()`, and `%` formatting.\r \r \r \r Lists\r \r Creating Lists\r \r - Lists are one of Python's built-in data types used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are ordered, mutable, and can contain items of different data types.\r \r \r \r Basic List Operations\r \r - Lists support a variety of basic operations like concatenation (`+`), repetition (`*`), and membership (`in`).\r \r \r \r Indexing and Slicing in Lists\r \r - You can access individual elements or slices of a list using indexing and slicing. Indexing starts at 0, and slicing uses the `list[start:end:step]` syntax.\r \r \r \r Built-In Functions Used on Lists\r \r - Python provides several built-in functions that can be applied to lists, such as `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, and `sorted()`.\r \r \r \r List Methods\r \r - Python provides several useful methods for lists, such as `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `reverse()`, and `sort()`.\r \r \r \r The `del` Statement\r \r - The `del` statement is used to delete elements from a list or even delete the entire list. You can delete a specific element by its index or slice.\r \r \r \r Functions\r \r Built-in Functions\r \r - Python comes with several built-in functions for various operations, such as `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, `range()`, `input()`, etc. These functions are always available and don't require any imports.\r \r \r \r Commonly Used Modules\r \r - Python provides a vast standard library with built-in modules that you can import for extended functionality. Some commonly used modules are:\r \r - `math`: Mathematical operations.\r - `random`: Generating random numbers.\r - `datetime`: Working with dates and times.\r - `os`: Interfacing with the operating system.\r \r \r \r Definition and Calling the Function\r \r - A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. A function can be called by using its name followed by parentheses.\r \r \r \r Return Statement and Void Function\r \r - A function can return a value using the `return` statement. If no return statement is present, or the function returns `None`, it's considered a \"void function\".\r \r \r \r Scope and Lifetime of Variables\r \r - Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside. Variables defined outside any function are global, but you cannot modify global variables inside a function unless explicitly stated using the `global` keyword.\r \r \r \r Default Parameters\r \r - You can provide default values to function parameters. If the caller doesn't pass a value, the default will be used.\r \r \r \r Keyword Arguments\r \r - Python allows you to call functions using keyword arguments, where the name of the argument is explicitly mentioned, making the function calls more readable.\r \r \r \r Command Line Arguments\r \r - Python allows you to pass arguments to your script from the command line using the `sys` module. The `sys.argv` list stores these arguments.\r \r \r \r Questions\r \r 1. What is a string in Python? Explain string operations with an example.\r 2. What is string slicing?

The file may be in the text or binary format, and each line of a file is ended with the special character like a comma (,) or a newline character.\r - Python executes the code line by line. So, it works in one line and then asks the interpreter to start the new line again.\r - This is a continuous process in Python.\r \r Types of Python Files\r \r Binary Files\r \r Most of the files that we see in our computer system are called binary files.\r \r - Document files: .pdf, .doc, .xls etc.\r - Image files: .png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp etc.\r - Video files: .mp4, .3gp, .mkv, .avi etc.\r - Audio files: .mp3, .wav, .mka, .aac etc.\r - Database files: .mdb, .accde, .frm, .sqlite etc.\r - Archive files: .zip, .rar, .iso, .7z etc.\r - Executable files: .exe, .dll, .class etc.\r - All binary files follow a specific format. We can open some binary files in the normal text editor but we can’t read the content present inside the file.\r - That’s because all the binary files will be encoded in the binary format, which can be understood only by a computer or machine.\r - For handling such binary files we need a specific type of software to open it.\r \r Text Files\r \r Text files don’t have any specific encoding and it can be opened in normal text editor itself.\r \r - Web standards: html, XML, CSS, JSON etc.\r - Source code: c, app, js, py, java etc.\r - Documents: txt, tex, RTF etc.\r - Tabular data: csv, tsv etc.\r - Configuration: ini, cfg, reg etc\r \r Difference between Text Files & Binary Files\r \r | Text File                               | Binary File                                                                   |\r | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r | The bits represent characters.          | The bits represent custom data.                                               |\r | Contains alphabets, numbers, etc.       | Typically contains a sequence of bytes or ordered groupings of eight bits.    |\r | Less prone to corruption with changes.  | More prone to corruption.                                                     |\r | Can only store plain text.              | Can store text, images, audio, etc.                                           |\r | Can be opened in any basic text editor. | Requires specific applications to open (e.g., music players for audio files). |\r | Common extensions include .txt or .rtf. | Many different extensions (e.g., .jpg, .zip, .mp4).                           |\r | Occupies less memory.                   | Occupies more memory.                                                         |\r | Stores data in a human-readable format. | Not in a human-readable format.                                               |\r \r File Handling Operations\r \r Create and Open a File\r \r - Python has an in-built function called `open()` to open a file.\r - It takes a minimum of one argument as mentioned in the below syntax.\r - The open method returns a file object which is used to access the write, read and other in-built methods.\r - The mode in the open function syntax will tell Python as what operation you want to do on a file.\r \r \r \r #### Modes\r \r | Parameter | Mode                 | Description                                                                          |\r | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r | `r`       | Read Mode            | Used only to read data from the file.                                                |\r | `w`       | Write Mode           | Used to write data into the file or modify it; overwrites existing data in the file. |\r | `a`       | Append Mode          | Used to append data to the file; data is added at the end of the file pointer.       |\r | `r+`      | Read/Write           | Used to read from and write to the same file.

PL/SQL is a procedural extension of SQL, making it extremely simple to write procedural code that includes SQL as if it were a single language.\r - The data types in PL/SQL are a super-set of those in the database, so you rarely need to perform data type conversions when using PL/SQL.\r \r \r \r Features of PLSQL\r \r - PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages.\r - PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.\r - One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications.\r - PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling block.\r - Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is operational.\r - PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking\r \r Difference Between SQL and PLSQL\r \r | SQL                                                                      | PLSQL                                                                                             |\r | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r | SQL is a single query that is used to perform DML and DDL operations.    | PL/SQL is a block of codes that used to write the entire program blocks/ procedure/ function, etc |\r | It defines what needs to be done, rather than how things need to be done | PL/SQL is procedural that defines how the things needs to be done                                 |\r | Executes as a single statement.                                          | Executes as a whole block.                                                                        |\r | Mainly used to manipulate data.                                          | Mainly used to create an application                                                              |\r | Cannot contain PL/SQL code in it.                                        | It is an extension of SQL, so it can contain SQL inside it.                                       |\r \r Dr. Codd's Rules\r \r RULE-00: The Foundation Rule:\r \r - The database must be in relational form.\r - So that the system can handle the database through its relational capabilities.\r \r RULE-01: Information Rule:\r \r - A database contains various information, and this information must be stored in each cell of a table in the form of rows and columns.\r \r RULE-02: Guaranteed Access Rule:\r \r - Every single or precise data (atomic value) may be accessed logically from a relational database using the combination of primary key value, table name, and column name.\r \r RULE-03: Systematic Treatment of Null Values:\r \r - This rule defines the systematic treatment of Null values in database records.\r - The null value has various meanings in the database, like missing the data, no value in a cell, inappropriate information, unknown data and the primary key should not be null\r \r RULE-04: Active/Dynamic Online Catalogue based on the relational model:\r \r - It represents the entire logical structure of the descriptive database that must be stored online and is known as a database dictionary.\r - It authorizes users to access the database and implement a similar query language to access the database\r \r RULE-05: Comprehensive Data Sub-Language Rule:\r \r - The relational database supports various languages, and if we want to access the database, the language must be the explicit, linear or well-defined syntax, character strings and supports the comprehensive: data definition, view definition, data manipulation, integrity constraints, and limit transaction management operations.\r - If the database allows access to the data without any language, it is considered a violation of the database\r \r RULE-06: View Updating Rule:\r \r - All views table can be theoretically updated and must be practically updated by the database systems.\r \r RULE-07: Relational Level Operation (High-Level Insert, Update and delete) Rule:\r \r - A database system should follow high-level relational operations such as insert, update, and delete in each level or a single row.\r - It also supports union, intersection and minus operation in the database system.\r \r RULE-08: Physical Data Independence Rule:\r \r - All stored data in a database or an application must be physically independent to access the database.\r - Each data should not depend on other data or an application.\r - If data is updated or the physical structure of the database is changed, it will not show any effect on external applications that are accessing the data from the database.\r \r RULE-09: Logical Data Independence Rule:\r \r - It is similar to physical data independence.

Functions have a unique name by which it can be referred. These are stored as PL/SQL database objects\r - Characteristics of Functions:\r   - Functions are a standalone block that is mainly used for calculation purpose.\r   - Function use RETURN keyword to return the value, and the datatype of this is defined at the time of creation\r   - A Function should either return a value or raise the exception, i.e. return is mandatory in functions\r   - Function with no DML statements can be directly called in SELECT query whereas the function with DML operation can only be called from other PL/SQL blocks.\r   - It can have nested blocks, or it can be defined and nested inside the other blocks or packages.\r   - It contains declaration part (optional), execution part, exception handling part (optional).\r   - The values can be passed into the function or fetched from the procedure through the parameters.\r   - These parameters should be included in the calling statement.\r   - A PLSQL function can also return the value through OUT parameters other than using RETURN.\r \r \r \r - The function must contain a return statement. RETURN clause specifies that data type you are going to return from the function.\r - Function body contains the executable part.\r - The AS keyword is used instead of the IS keyword for creating a standalone function.\r \r \r \r \r \r - To remove already created function use `DROP FUNCTION function_name`\r \r Procedure\r \r - A procedure is a PL/SQL block which performs one or more specific tasks.\r - The procedure contains a header and a body\r   - Header: The header contains the name of the procedure and the parameters or variables passed to the procedure.\r   - Body: The body contains a declaration section, execution section and exception section similar to a general PL/SQL block.\r - When you want to create a procedure or function, you have to define parameters.\r - There are three ways to pass parameters in procedure:\r   - IN parameters: The IN parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function. The value of the parameter cannot be overwritten by the procedure or the function.\r   - OUT parameters: The OUT parameter cannot be referenced by the procedure or function, but the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.\r   - INOUT parameters: The INOUT parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function and the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.\r \r \r \r \r \r - To drop already created procedure use `DROP PROCEDURE name;`\r \r Stored procedure\r \r - A stored procedure is a series of declarative SQL statements which can be stored in the database catalogue.\r - A procedure can be thought of as a function or a method.\r - They can be invoked through triggers, other procedures, or applications on Java, PHP etc.\r - Advantages:\r   - They result in performance improvement of the application.\r   - If a procedure is being called frequently in an application in a single connection, then the compiled version of the procedure is delivered.\r   - They reduce the traffic between the database and the application, since the lengthy statements are already fed into the database and need not be sent again and again via the application.\r   - They add to code reusability, similar to how functions and methods work in other languages such as C/C++ and Java.\r - Disadvantages:\r   - Stored procedures can cause a lot of memory usage.

It allows for sequential processing of the rows in the result set, enabling manipulation of data row by row.\r \r Cursor Operations\r \r - Declaration: Cursors are declared with a `SELECT` statement, specifying the query to be executed.\r - Opening: Once declared, a cursor needs to be opened to execute the associated query and establish a result set.\r - Fetching: After opening, rows from the result set can be fetched one at a time or in bulk for processing.\r - Processing: Fetched data can be processed within loops or other control structures, allowing for various operations such as manipulation, aggregation, or validation.\r - Closing: After processing, the cursor should be closed to release resources and free up memory.\r \r Common Use\r \r - Data Manipulation: Cursors are used to retrieve and modify data row by row, enabling complex data processing tasks.\r - Data Validation: They are helpful in validating data against certain criteria or constraints.\r - Reporting: Cursors facilitate generating reports by iterating over result sets and formatting data for display.\r \r Considerations\r \r - Performance: Cursors can impact performance, especially when used with large result sets. Efficient query design and optimization techniques should be employed.\r - Resource Management: Proper cursor management is essential to prevent resource leaks and optimize memory usage.\r - Concurrency: Cursors can be sensitive to changes made by other transactions. Appropriate isolation levels and locking mechanisms should be considered in multi-user environments.\r \r Implicit Cursor\r \r - Automatically created by the database management system (DBMS) to handle queries.\r - They are simple to use but offer limited control over query execution.\r - These are created by default by ORACLE itself when DML statements like, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements are executed.\r - They are also created when a `SELECT` statement that returns just one row is executed.\r - We cannot use implicit cursors for user defined work.\r \r Explicit Cursor\r \r - Defined explicitly by the programmer using SQL commands.\r - They provide more control over the result set, allowing for fine-tuning of data retrieval and manipulation.\r - Explicit cursors are user defined cursors written by the developer.\r - They can be created when a `SELECT` statement that returns more than one row is executed.\r - Even though the cursor stores multiple records, only one record can be processed at a time, which is called as current row. (When you fetch a row, the current row position moves to next row.)\r \r Steps to Manage Explicit Cursor\r \r Declare: A cursor is defined in the declaration section of PL/SQL block\r \r \r \r Open A Cursor: Once cursor is declared we can open it.\r \r - When cursor is opened following operations are performed.\r   - Memory is allocated to store the data.\r   - Execute `SELECT` statement associated with cursor\r   - Create active data set by retrieving data from table\r   - Set the cursor row pointer to point to first record in active data set.\r \r \r \r Fetching Data: We cannot process selected row directly. We have to fetch column values of a row into memory variables. This is done by `FETCH` statement.\r \r \r \r Processing Data: This step involves actual processing of current row.\r \r Closing Cursor: A cursor should be closed after the processing of data completes. Once you close the cursor it will release memory allocated for that cursor.\r \r \r \r Deallocating Cursor: It is used to delete a cursor and releases all resources used by cursor.\r \r \r \r Cursor Attributes\r \r - Oracle provides some attributes known as Implicit cursor's attributes to check the status of DML operations.\r \r | Attributes | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |\r | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r | %FOUND     | Its return value is TRUE if DML statements like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE affect at least one row or more rows or a SELECT INTO statement returned one or more rows.
