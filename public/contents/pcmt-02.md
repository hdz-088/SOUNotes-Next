## Repairing Software Problems

- Your PC uses the operating system and installed software programs during normal operation. If your PC works improperly or stops because of the software, you may be able to repair it.
- Some software repairs are as simple as restarting your PC, and others require performing a System Recovery from files on your hard disk drive
- Your hard disk drive contains a System Recovery image that includes all the software files that were originally installed on your PC at the factory. In the unlikely event that you need to recover your system, it is easy to do so using this recovery image
- Because all the necessary information is contained in the System Recovery image on your hard disk drive, recovery discs are not included in the accessory box
- As a backup, you can: Make your own System Recovery discs from the recovery image as described in “Creating System Recovery Discs“ on page 18.
